<h3>2022-04-17 The Canonization Manifesto: A Hypothetical Architecture Thesis</h3>			

<p>
<strong>Canon</strong>ization is any of a number of emergent phenomena whereby an abundance of knowledge is filtered into <strong>canon</strong>ical narratives especially those encountered in a field of knowledge production. Wishing to emphasize the plural and coexisting nature of <strong>canon</strong>s, note that, at every scale, individuals appear to filter and fit each piece of knowledge they come across into a personal narrative or head-<strong>canon</strong>. Due to this constant reinterpretation, describing the behavior of emergent unified narratives at a macroscopic level has led to many terms scattered across the fields of knowledge production. Thus I seek to perform some mathematics - once described as "the art of giving the same name to different things".
<br><br>
	Rather than proposing a theoretical framework around <strong>canon</strong>ization, my practice aims simply to aggregate perspectives that may be useful for studying their general role in the trans-disciplinary field of knowledge production consisting of art, science, design, engineering, craft, and surely others - as described by artists, philosophers, art historians, science historians, art critics, ethnographers, media ethnographers, anthropologists, sociologists, urban planners, psychologists, science technology and society scholars, practitioners in these fields, pedagogy researchers, outsiders, public perceptions, etc.
<br><br>
Some <strong>canon</strong>ical narratives are intimately shaped by epistemologies - systems of verification, belief, and trust. These systems define the extent to which one outsources belief to others' narratives. These are particularly significant for looking at modernity since the Enlightenment as technology has consisted of more and more layers of abstract thinking. These are based on models one may call molecular or nuclear whose unraveling far exceed an individual's comprehension. In that sense, these are ways of grappling with the need to develop <strong>canon</strong>ical narratives to live with an increasingly cyborgian existence.
<br><br>
Other <strong>canon</strong>ical narratives rely on ontologies - systems of definition and understanding. These systems attempt to address questions of scale and scope - what constitutes the physical extent of an object and how far into an infinite regression of abstract or virtual properties and relationships one ought to consider. Related are critical frameworks which are <strong>canon</strong>ical narratives one temporarily adopts to force oneself to analyze a particular perspective of a system or work of knowledge production. Others are considering the value of coexisting ontologies such as using indigenous or archaeologically rediscovered understandings which emphasize non-human species in order to consider conscious or sustainable design.
<br><br>
Practitioners of a field of knowledge production tend to utilize field-specific <strong>canon</strong>ical narratives. Due to an abundance of tacit knowledge necessary to operate in an efficient manner, it seems reasonable to have a list of memorized surface-level maxims, axioms, posits, aphorisms, particularly useful results, and a common lexicon to begin the learning process. Hierarchical models of learning tend to call this learning the rules before one breaks them in a risky act of post-<strong>canon</strong>ical synthesis. This is partially related to the necessity to identify with and be accepted within a field to avoid a state of schizophrenia. The inertia perpetuating choices of broad macroscopic ideas have been called paradigms consisting of a shared system of analogies one uses to understand their own work or epistemes emphasizing the power structures that reinforce them.
<br><br>
Outside of personal interpretations, some macroscopic changes in <strong>canon</strong>ical narratives constitute deterritorialization where a nonlinear narrative has its context removed and is stated as a basic axiom, obscuring its construction, or compressed to a face of a concept. One particular example is the construction of an aesthetic i.e. naming a <strong>canon</strong>ical set of visual cultural elements - especially anachronistic conglomerations. Other examples include appropriation of the word deterritorialization in this paragraph, commodification in general, and attempts to preemptively teach pragmatic models like the scientific method, writing process, or engineering design process without including practice in each context. This further separates the perception and reality of epistemological understanding perhaps to a level of foreign religious enchantment.
<br><br>
Possibilities of larger changes lie in post-modern re-configurations. Current ideas include archaeological reconstruction of <strong>canon</strong>ical narratives and adjustment of practices - both with systematic awareness of the inertia of colonizing structures. Another is separating practices from economic desires for a growth imperative - which may allow time for discussions and practice opportunities which improve value and perception of fields of knowledge production and allow for more freedom to conduct experimental post-<strong>canon</strong>ical development.
<br><br>
Finally, in accelerating society, the repetition of <strong>canon</strong>ical responses rises to the level of noise leading to a question of how to deal with over-stimulation and schizophrenia - and the epistemological choice to outsource one's <strong>canon</strong>ical narratives to others' algorithmic filters.
