<li> Chucho (Jes&uacute;s) Ocampo Aguilar, a fellow walking artist in MIT's Program in Art, Culture, & Technology, recommended  Francesco Careri's <a href= "https://culicidaearchitecturalpress.com/careri-walkscapes/">Walkscapes</a> as it informs his <a href="https://derivelab.org/"> Practice</a>. It begins by introducing the role of nomadic goers as opposed to sedentary stayers in the history of architecture, followed by an overview of modern walking art, focusing on <a href= "https://www.moma.org/collection/works/184056">Dada Visites</a>, Surrealist deambulations, and  <a href="https://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/theory.html"> Letterist/Situationist D&eacute;rives</a>. It ends with modern architectural Land Art practices.</li>
<li> A substantial number of works on walking have been reviewed <a href= "https://readingandwalking.wpcomstaging.com/">here</a> and on other blogs. </li>
<li> An exploration of every street in NYC by Matt Green is documented <a href= "https://imjustwalkin.com/">here</a> and in the walkumentary, <a href= "https://www.theworldbeforeyourfeet.com/"> The World Before Your Feet</a>. </li>
<li> Also featured in this walkumentary is a fellow walker and former MIT MLK Scholar, Garnette Cadogan, writer of the essay <a href= "https://lithub.com/walking-while-black/"> Walking While Black </a> on the role of race in the walking experience. </li>
<li> In the more anthropological direction, Tim Ingold writes on the cultural significance of <a href= "https://www.google.com/books/edition/Lines/50z7CwAAQBAJ"> Lines </a> while part of the collective <a href= "https://www.deveron-projects.com/the-walking-institute/people/"> The Walking Institute </a> which hosts academics on journeys through Scotland. </li>
<li> In a more athletic vein, a few individuals known as <a href= "https://www.unitedstatescenturionwalkers.com/"> Centurions</a> have continued the tradition of pedestrianism, walking 100mi in one day. (Others have taken on the simpler Kennedy March as proposed by JFK in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_march"> Sports Illustrated </a> to promote physical education - the Centurion Society providing Kennedy March medals if completed in 12 hours).</li>
<li> These walks involve relaxed versions of <a href= "https://www.usatf.org/disciplines/race-walking"> Racewalking</a> rules, no loss of contact and full leg extension, which ultimately limit the race to a track so judges can stare at the racers' legs. Slow-motion cameras were banned it was determined every racewalker was losing contact already and the standard was reduced.</li>
<li> Walks can be tracked to some capacity on <a href= "https://www.google.com/maps/d/"> Google MyMaps</a> but you're limited in layers and exports. There are other programs designed to integrate with biometric sensors or to explore other individuals' walks which are not part of my performative practice.</li>
<li> Of course, if you would walk 500mi and you would walk 500 more and then 500 more and your significant other would too just to break up, look no further than <a href="https://publicdelivery.org/marina-abramovic-the-lovers-the-great-wall-walk/"> Marina AbramoviÄ‡ & Ulay </a></li>
