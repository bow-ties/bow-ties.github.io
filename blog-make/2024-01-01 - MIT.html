<h3>2024-01-01 - MIT Institutional Knowledge and Fun Historical Facts</h3>

<h4>Environment, Health, and Safety</h4>
	<b>1949</b> - MIT hires a safety officer (Main history <a href="https://news.mit.edu/1999/safety-0929">source</a> - this article also mentions mustard gas, jet fuel incidents)
	<br><b>1965</b> - Cambridge Electron Accelerator Fire led to on-call program and safety procedures for minors (fun aside on the CEA is this quote from MIT Physics donor Virgil Elings's thesis: "[Prof. Louis Osbourne's technical assistant, William] Lobar's unselfish assistance in rescuing the data during the explosion at the Cambridge Electron Accelerator is deeply appreciated")
	<br><b>1972</b> - A physics grad student, <a href="https://www.labsafety.org/memorial-wall">Shri Krishna Singh</a>, is electrocuted leading to MIT's first OSHA inspection. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OSHA inspections of 30 buildings discover "unchained gas cylinders, step ladders with broken, steps, vacuum pumps and other mechanical equipment with unprotected belts and pulleys, bicycles chained in stairways, improper temporary wiring, exposed high-voltage wiring or components, and generally cluttered halls" <a href="https://thetech.com/issues/92/50/pdf">(source)</a>.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MIT asks DLCs to appoint <b>safety coordinators</b>. <a href="https://dome.mit.edu/handle/1721.3/59054">(source)</a> who eventually conduct annual inspections
	<br><b>1975</b> - Due to the Clean Water Act, MIT's hazardous waste contractor loses its ocean-dumping permit leading MIT to struggle to locate a contractor to incinerate or bury diverse small-quantity wastes. <a href="https://dome.mit.edu/handle/1721.3/59055">(source)</a>, <a href="https://dome.mit.edu/handle/1721.3/59056">(source)</a>
	<br><b>1986</b> - MIT must submit a <b>chemical inventory</b> annually to the Local Emergency Planning Committee as a result of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 Title III: Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act
	<br><b>1987</b> - OSHA <b>Hazard Communication</b> Program is extended from manufacturing to all industries; a Hazard Communication Plan and training on reading a MSDS is required. [29 CFR 1910.1200 "Hazard Communication."]'
	<br><b>1990</b> - Each DLC must have a <b>Chemical Hygeine Plan</b> annually renewed by the Chemical Hygiene Officer  [29 CFR 1910.1450 "Occupational exposure to hazardous chemicals in laboratories."] 
	<br><b>1998</b> - EPA inspection occurs; Findings include 18 violations of Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is found that MIT "Violated federal hazardous waste emergency, storage, handling and labeling regulations. Violations were found in 56 of 114 laboratories inspected...Failed to keep an opacity monitor on its medical waste incinerator in working order and violated several reporting requirements relating to the use of fuels in MIT's power plant...Did not have an adequate and fully implemented oil spill prevention plan." 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is considered "middle of the pack" for research universities. (<a href="https://www.epa.gov/archive/epapages/newsroom_archive/newsreleases/53ef1969f9e8bc9d8525742400029be7.html">source</a>) (<a href="https://thetech.com/issues/121/19/pdf">source</a>)

<h4>The internals of MITx Online / Open edX:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The server looks at a json configuration file pointing to courses along with start/end date info. The server finds the `course`s which are xml files in a `course` folder and a json file in the `policy` folder which defines assignment categories and their weights.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The `course` contains `chapter`s which contain `html`s and `sequential`s which contain `html`s and `vertical`s which contain `html`s and `problem`s which contain `html`s and `Response`s/`Solution`s which both contain `html`s. At any point these can be written directly in the xml file or included with a url attribute which is resolved in the chapter, sequential, vertical, problem, or html folders. Historically, one could use subfolders and colons in the url attribute but that practice has been deprecated in favor of very long filenames...
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A `sequential` has an assigned grading category. A `problem` has an assigned number of points, attempts, and relative weights. The `Response`s have assigned points and can be of many types including `FormulaResponse`, `NumericalResponse`, and `CustomResponse`.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`FormulaResponse`s grade by substituting values for each allowed variable in both the expected and students' responses. The range of values to check and number of samples are configurable. This leads to some edge cases if say a variable is always sampled as 2 or the expected answer is indistinguishable from zero or an expression becomes undefined unless simplified. `NumericalResponse`s allow a tolerance, partial credit, and a range. `CustomResponse`s allow you to assign points from a javascript or python script.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In principle, the entire course can be a single xml file or a policy.json file that overrides every attribute.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A common setup for edX is to pull code from a live branch of a git repository to publish to students and also pull from a staging branch to a separate staging site for testing. By using the git integration, changes made in the edX Studio interface will be overridden. Before pushing code, one should check for errors using edx-cleaner from the <a href="https://github.com/jolyonb/olxcleaner">olxcleaner</a> package. Fun fact: if you set an assignment date to one which does not exist like February 29th, the server's parser will error out and the rest of your course will fail to import. This will not be logged.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively, one could use the edX Studio interface which will generate xml files with garbled names which are hard to reuse between courses without copy/pasting from the inconsistent Studio interface with different views for 'html's and 'problem's or the "staff debug info" button which will dump the raw xml.

<h4>Other technology upgrades:</h4>
	<b>1999 - 2006</b>, Microsoft committed $25,000,000 to fund technology-based education projects at MIT through the <a href="https://icampus.mit.edu"/>iCampus</a> initiative: Technology Enabled Active Learning (TEAL), the iCampus / MIT Online Assessment Tool (iMoat) used for the Freshman/First-year Essay Evaluation over a decade later, XTutor (a precursor to catsoop and MITx answer checkers) and the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/fluids-modules/www/">School-wide Modular Program on Fluid Mechanics</a>. Related projects are in this <a href="https://web.mit.edu/edtech/projects/gallery.html">galley</a>.

<h4>Research Funding:</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>MIT is assigned to the Office of Naval Research as its Cognizant Agency (<a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-2/subtitle-A/chapter-II/part-200/appendix-Appendix%20III%20to%20Part%20200">as more funds were from the DOD than HHS in the previous years</a>) with which it negotiates indirect cost rates (those which cannot be attributed to a specific research project i.e. 50-75% <a href="https://ras.mit.edu/rates/federal-research-facilities-and-administrative-fa-rates">Facilities and Administration</a> and 10% education)</li>
	<li>Internal audits occur every 3-4 years (arose in the 80s from fear of fines that scale - the funding agency will audit some fraction then extrapolate to a lump sum - "Stanford had the yacht", Harvard house renovation, faculty at Duke: "you can't suspend my procurement card - I'll lose my gym membership")</li>
	<li>Physics handles ~40 non-government grants and ~230 grad student appointments</li>
	</ul>

<h4>Mailing Lists:</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Mailing lists can be managed here: <a href="https://groups.mit.edu/webmoira/">https://groups.mit.edu/webmoira/</a> ; be sure to use Moira lists rather than mailman unless you really need anonymity/moderation. 
	<li>To unsubscribe from a mailman list, simply visit "https://mailman.mit.edu:444/mailman/options/some-mailman-list-you-are-on/your-kerberos@mit.edu" </li>
	<li>It is possible to send as a mailing list (or as anything@mit.edu but you'll only get replies if the mailing list forwards to you) via <a href="http://kb.mit.edu/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=5898573">this method</a>. Note this still leaves your athena login in the email headers. </li>
	<li>More advanced functions can be done via <a href="https://debathena.mit.edu/manpages/www/manpages/lucid/man1/blanche.1.html">blanche</a></li>
	</ul>
	
	
<h4>Financials:</h4>
	<p>
	Purchases and revenues are billed to accounts called Cost Objects AKA cost collectors AKA cost objectives AKA Funds. There are three classes of Cost Objects (https://vpf.mit.edu/cost-objects):
	<br>
	Cost Centers - MIT central funds budgeted each fiscal year
	<br>
	Internal Orders (prefix I) - non-sponsored funds, can collect interest
	<br>
	Work Breakdown Structures (WBS, prefix P) - from sponsored funds, scrutinized for allowable expenses, have end date
	</p>
	Cost objects are assigned in ranges as follows:
	<ul>
	<li>I 1000000-I 1329999 - internal order balance sheets for non-MIT/deferred</li>
	<li>P 1000000-P 1329999 - WBS balance sheets for non-MIT/deferred</li>
	<li>C 1330000-C 1379999 - cost centers for self-funding operations (internal services)</li>
	<li>C 1380000-C 1999999 - cost centers for admin/instructional operations</li>
	<li>I 2000000-I 2999999 - internal orders for instructional discretionary/organization expendable</li>
	<li>P 2000000-P 2999999 - WBS instructional (fellowships, workshops) expendable</li>
	<li>I 3000000-I 3668999 - internal orders funded by interest on endowment funds (Pool A)</li>
	<li>I 3669000-I 4479999 - internal orders discretionary/organization funded by interest on other investment funds (Pool C)</li>
	<li>P 3669000-P 4479999 - WBS instructional (fellowships, workshops)</li>
	<li>I 4300000-I 4480000 - internal orders for Internal Operations not networking infrastructure</li>
	<li>P 4300000-P 4480000 - WBS for Internal Operations networking infrastructure</li>
	<li>P 4480000-P 4499999 - WBS for networking infrastructure</li>
	<li>P 6000000-P 9999999 - WBS for sponsored research</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Fund Centers (FC) are virtual parents to which cost objects are required to be assigned for permission tracking.</p>
	<p>Profit Centers (PC) are virtual parents to which cost objects are assigned for convenience of accounting. </p>
	<p>The hierarchy can be viewed using the roles database (https://rolesweb.mit.edu/cost_object_info.html?sapSystemId=PS1) where it appears PCs are children of Hierarchical? Profit Centers (HPC).</p>
	<p>Purchases and revenues are also coded into General/Ledger (G/L) accounts AKA cost elements based on the type of purchase/revenue. These range from vague to hyperspecific based on need for approval needs, regulation, insurance, and/or sponsored research accounting: allowability, overhead expenses, indirect costs. Some examples: </p>
	<ul>
	<li>421588	Miscellaneous</li>
	<li>420226	Materials and Services</li>
	<li>420214	Laboratory Supplies</li>
	<li>420128	Chemicals</li>
	<li>420160	Electrical Components</li>
	<li>420232	Mechanical Components</li>
	<li>420258	Office Supplies</li>
	<li>421900 Computers (&gt;$1000), included in Electronic Data Processing Insurance values</li>
	<li>421827 Equip/Furniture-Minor ($1000-$5000) - tagged by the Property Office if computers over $1000 or an item over >$3000 with separate Enhancement features bringing value over $5000</li>
	<li>421818 Equip/Furniture-Major (>$5000) - "Capitalizable", tagged by Property Office, not part of the MTDC; complies with "Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 45, the NASA Federal Acquisition Regulations (NASA/FAR) Supplement Part 18-45, and the Department of Energy Regulation (DEAR) Subparts 945.5 and 917.74 of April 198"; similarly $5000 is the "maximum residual inventory" allowed from a closed WBS; capitalized equipment becomes part of MIT's total F&A expenses i.e. is excluded from the Modified Total Direct Cost (MTDC)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Most purchases should be made in Coupa which tracks requisitions and purchase orders. </p>
	<p>A Requisition is effectively a shopping cart.</p>
	<p>It contains line items which contain an item name/description/part number, a vendor, an expected cost, a commodity (an AI-generated Coupa-internal account that maps to a G/L account; sometimes these are very wrong like a squeeze bottle will be misclassified as "Meetings - Food & Beverages"), and a set of one or more Cost Object-G/L account combinations to charge.</p>
	<p>The requisition can be submitted through a series of approvers which are added based on permissions for the fund centers and other hooks based on contents.</p>
	<p>An approved requisition will be split into Purchase Orders sent to each supplier typically via email in the standard cXML format.</p>
	<p>The supplier then typically sends an invoice to MIT's Accounts Receivable address where it is placed on the PO. Alternatively, the buyer may need to forward the invoice manually. Duplicates break the system so some companies (Digikey) have been instructed to never automatically send any purchase info to the buyer to avoid duplicate invoice submissions.</p>
	<p>Typically, the products are presumed recieved a set period after the Invoice is received and the invoice is paid via the PO contract terms and the PO is Soft-Closed. Alternatively, the buyer may need to "recieve against" the PO and/or close it - otherwise it will be considered an outstanding cost on the annual budget closeout.</p>

	<p>Sporadically, coupa will create a corresponding Requisition/PO in SAP, MIT's "System of Record" for accounting purposes. When it doesn't budget tracking involves merging SAP and coupa reports to find outstanding POs.</p>

	<p>For purchases over $10000, the buyer must submit a Selection of Source Form with quotes.</p>
	<p>For purchases over 250000, a competitive contract search must be documented in a Selection of Source Form.</p>

	<p>Journal Vouchers (JVs) are fundamental transactions that allow moving money internally with explanatory attachments. JVs are used to move funds between receiving accounts, to complete internal purchases, or to correct errors.</p>

	<p>ProCards may be used for infrequent purchases with uploaded documentation prior to a swept-charge deadline.</p>

	<p>Requests For Payment (RFPs) can be used to reimburse nonstandard purchases excluding tax and with documentation. These are electronically sent to an approver's RFP inbox. This system has no method to check that you sent them to a person who can approve your purchase against the cost object.</p>

<h4>Commencement:</h4>
<ul>
	<li> MIT's Commencement is a fairly decentralized event. Technically, it is directed by the faculty Commencement Committee and the Executive Officer for Commencement, part of Institute Events, part of the office of the Secretary of the Corporation. The committee partly consists of senior student government presidents, the registrar, the Assistant Faculty Marshal, members from the Office of the President, Institute Affairs, the Office of the Vice Chancellor, etc. </li>
	<li> Facilities constructs and resets 4000 chairs for graduates and 11000 chairs for guests on Killian Court. An additional 4000 chairs are located in DuPont gymnasium as a backup space which also contains 4000 empty diploma holders. </li>
	<li> Diplomas are placed in holders (which arrive in boxes of 34 from The Union Group in Fall River, MA) and are sorted alphabetically within "stations" which may contain one or more majors or an alphabetical subset of a major. During the undergraduate ceremony, students arrive to the corresponding physical stations (now in Saxon Lawn, formerly in Johnson Track) standing for over an hour then march in 4 parallel lines to their seats. Graduates are guided by "Assistant Marshals" (staff members of no particular outside role who also wear fancy clothes).</li>
	<li> At the new OneMIT Ceremony, only the academic procession and 50-year alumni march in. The academic procession consists of (in some order): the institute photographer walking backwards, the chief marshal, the chair of the corporation, the president, past presidents, visiting university presidents, the Provost, the various Vice Provosts, the Chair of the Faculty, the various Vice Presidents, the Chancellor, the various Vice Chancellors, the CEO of the Alumni Association, the other members of the Academic Council, the speakers, the Deans of the Schools, the Heads of Departments, the Assistant Faculty Marshal, any interested faculty, interested "lecturers" who further constitute "The Academy". </li>
	<li> 300 staff and students are invited as Guest Services volunteers through the Division of Student Life to guide guests on the street, scan tickets, transport individuals with disabilities, staff the info tent, assist and maintain the flow of guests, and hold the rope lines to keep the aisle clear so that the procession of students is unobstructed. Volunteers staff General Seating zones 1-5, disabilities, and the VIP Section (guests of those on stage). The alumni association is responsible for the 25-year and 50-year alumni seating area.</li>
	<li> During Commencement, MIT Emergency Management maintains an Emergency Operations Center with representatives from all local emergency agencies in the TEAL room using the projection screens as a futuristic command center. To prevent a panic crowd crush event, campus alarms are silenced and responded to manually. A number of years ago, there was a low-oxygen alarm in building 13 during commencement and people were led out of the halls manually by a hazmat response team. Emergency Management also supplies sunscreen and ponchos (of which they have 35000 - even in 2024, most say MIT 2016 Celebrating a Century in Cambridge) which are provided to all graduates and guests if needed. A dedicated heating/cooling tent is also constructed to treat heat exhaustion or hypothermia - it is also used to store MIT wheelchairs. In wet weather, facilities will use floor scrubbers to remove water from the plastic flooring tiles and guests will be handed towels. On hot days, guest services volunteers will place water bottles under every seat.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Miscellany:</h4>
	<ul>
	<li> Once committed to MIT, you receive an Infinite Connection ID to make an account at https://alum.mit.edu/ . Until around 2020, the home address on your application was publicly available on the alumni directory even if you had yet to create an account.</li>
	<li>Some fun rooms:
	<ul>
	<li>6-017, Radiation Protection Program Central Isotope Storage, home of gammacell irradiator</li>
	<li>24-038 Main Accumulation Area which has the 4 4 4 NFPA diamond on the exterior door </li>
	<li>16-039 temperature and humidity controlled flammable or biological radioactive waste storage room with that I once saw the inside of when facilities was checking for basement flooding.</li>
	<li>10-086 which is a room only accessible through a "telephone room" and whose purpose is VAULT and whose owner is Vice President for Finance. Apparently, the lounge above which also has a VAULT used to be the office where you collected your paycheck</li>
	<li>when 26-100 was last renovated, the handrails they bought were an inch too long to line up with the 4 bolt holes in the floor under each leg so they tossed the pallet of 36 railings in the back and bought new ones</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>For long-range planning, MIT is currently following the <a href="https://web.mit.edu/mit2030/">2030 Framework</a> which includes the <a href="https://web.mit.edu/mit2030/themes/renovation-renewal-stewardship/accelerated-capital-renewal.html">Accelerated Capital Renewal initiative (ACR)</a> priorities and the <a href="https://web.mit.edu/mit2030/projects/eastcampusgateway/index.html">East campus/Kendall gateway urban design study</a> with planning from 2009-2014 through construction into the 2020s. Funding for current construction is included in the Resource Development <a href="https://betterworld.mit.edu/">Campaign for a Better World</a> </li>
