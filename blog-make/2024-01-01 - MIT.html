<h3>2024-01-01 - MIT Institutional Knowledge and Fun Historical Facts</h3>

<h4>Environment, Health, and Safety</h4>
	<b>1949</b> - MIT hires a safety officer (Main history <a href="https://news.mit.edu/1999/safety-0929">source</a> - this article also mentions mustard gas, jet fuel incidents)
	<br><b>1965</b> - Cambridge Electron Accelerator Fire led to on-call program and safety procedures for minors (fun aside on the CEA is this quote from MIT Physics donor Virgil Elings's thesis: "[Prof. Louis Osbourne's technical assistant, William] Lobar's unselfish assistance in rescuing the data during the explosion at the Cambridge Electron Accelerator is deeply appreciated")
	<br><b>1972</b> - A physics grad student, <a href="https://www.labsafety.org/memorial-wall">Shri Krishna Singh</a>, is electrocuted leading to MIT's first OSHA inspection. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OSHA inspections of 30 buildings discover "unchained gas cylinders, step ladders with broken, steps, vacuum pumps and other mechanical equipment with unprotected belts and pulleys, bicycles chained in stairways, improper temporary wiring, exposed high-voltage wiring or components, and generally cluttered halls" <a href="https://thetech.com/issues/92/50/pdf">(source)</a>.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MIT asks DLCs to appoint <b>safety coordinators</b>. <a href="https://dome.mit.edu/handle/1721.3/59054">(source)</a> who eventually conduct annual inspections
	<br><b>1975</b> - Due to the Clean Water Act, MIT's hazardous waste contractor loses its ocean-dumping permit leading MIT to struggle to locate a contractor to incinerate or bury diverse small-quantity wastes. <a href="https://dome.mit.edu/handle/1721.3/59055">(source)</a>, <a href="https://dome.mit.edu/handle/1721.3/59056">(source)</a>
	<br><b>1986</b> - MIT must submit a <b>chemical inventory</b> annually to the Local Emergency Planning Committee as a result of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 Title III: Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act
	<br><b>1987</b> - OSHA <b>Hazard Communication</b> Program is extended from manufacturing to all industries; a Hazard Communication Plan and training on reading a MSDS is required. [29 CFR 1910.1200 "Hazard Communication."]'
	<br><b>1990</b> - Each DLC must have a <b>Chemical Hygeine Plan</b> annually renewed by the Chemical Hygiene Officer  [29 CFR 1910.1450 "Occupational exposure to hazardous chemicals in laboratories."] 
	<br><b>1998</b> - EPA inspection occurs; Findings include 18 violations of Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is found that MIT "Violated federal hazardous waste emergency, storage, handling and labeling regulations. Violations were found in 56 of 114 laboratories inspected...Failed to keep an opacity monitor on its medical waste incinerator in working order and violated several reporting requirements relating to the use of fuels in MIT's power plant...Did not have an adequate and fully implemented oil spill prevention plan." 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is considered "middle of the pack" for research universities. (<a href="https://www.epa.gov/archive/epapages/newsroom_archive/newsreleases/53ef1969f9e8bc9d8525742400029be7.html">source</a>) (<a href="https://thetech.com/issues/121/19/pdf">source</a>)

<h4>The internals of MITx Online / Open edX:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The server looks at a json configuration file pointing to courses along with start/end date info. The server finds the `course`s which are xml files in a `course` folder and a json file in the `policy` folder which defines assignment categories and their weights.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The `course` contains `chapter`s which contain `html`s and `sequential`s which contain `html`s and `vertical`s which contain `html`s and `problem`s which contain `html`s and `Response`s/`Solution`s which both contain `html`s. At any point these can be written directly in the xml file or included with a url attribute which is resolved in the chapter, sequential, vertical, problem, or html folders. Historically, one could use subfolders and colons in the url attribute but that practice has been deprecated in favor of very long filenames...
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A `sequential` has an assigned grading category. A `problem` has an assigned number of points, attempts, and relative weights. The `Response`s have assigned points and can be of many types including `FormulaResponse`, `NumericalResponse`, and `CustomResponse`.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`FormulaResponse`s grade by substituting values for each allowed variable in both the expected and students' responses. The range of values to check and number of samples are configurable. This leads to some edge cases if say a variable is always sampled as 2 or the expected answer is indistinguishable from zero or an expression becomes undefined unless simplified. `NumericalResponse`s allow a tolerance, partial credit, and a range. `CustomResponse`s allow you to assign points from a javascript or python script.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In principle, the entire course can be a single xml file or a policy.json file that overrides every attribute.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A common setup for edX is to pull code from a live branch of a git repository to publish to students and also pull from a staging branch to a separate staging site for testing. By using the git integration, changes made in the edX Studio interface will be overridden. Before pushing code, one should check for errors using edx-cleaner from the <a href="https://github.com/jolyonb/olxcleaner">olxcleaner</a> package. Fun fact: if you set an assignment date to one which does not exist like February 29th, the server's parser will error out and the rest of your course will fail to import. This will not be logged.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively, one could use the edX Studio interface which will generate xml files with garbled names which are hard to reuse between courses without copy/pasting from the inconsistent Studio interface with different views for 'html's and 'problem's or the "staff debug info" button which will dump the raw xml.

<h4>Other technology upgrades:</h4>
	<b>1999 - 2006</b>, Microsoft committed $25,000,000 to fund technology-based education projects at MIT through the <a href="https://icampus.mit.edu"/>iCampus</a> initiative: Technology Enabled Active Learning (TEAL), the iCampus / MIT Online Assessment Tool (iMoat) used for the Freshman/First-year Essay Evaluation over a decade later, XTutor (a precursor to catsoop and MITx answer checkers) and the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/fluids-modules/www/">School-wide Modular Program on Fluid Mechanics</a>.

<h4>Research Funding:</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>MIT is assigned to the Office of Naval Research as its Cognizant Agency (<a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-2/subtitle-A/chapter-II/part-200/appendix-Appendix%20III%20to%20Part%20200">as more funds were from the DOD than HHS in the previous years</a>). is the , the indirect cost rates (those which cannot be attributed to a specific research project i.e. 50-75% <a href="https://ras.mit.edu/rates/federal-research-facilities-and-administrative-fa-rates">Facilities and Administration</a> and 10% education)</li>
	<li>Internal audits every 3-4 years (arose in the 80s from fear of fines that scale - the funding agency will audit some fraction then extrapolate to a lump sum - "Stanford had the yacht", Harvard house renovation, faculty at Duke: "you can't suspend my procurement card - I'll lose my gym membership")</li>
	<li>Physics handles ~40 non-government grants and ~230 grad student appointments</li>
	</ul>

<h4>Mailing Lists:</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Mailing lists can be managed here: <a href="https://groups.mit.edu/webmoira/">https://groups.mit.edu/webmoira/</a> ; be sure to use Moira lists rather than mailman unless you really need anonymity/moderation.

	</ul>


<h4>Miscellany:</h4>
	<ul>
	<li> Once committed to MIT, you receive an Infinite Connection ID to make an account at https://alum.mit.edu/ . Until around 2020, the home address on your application was publicly available on the alumni directory even if you had yet to create an account.</li>
	<li>Some fun rooms:
	<ul>
	<li>6-017, Radiation Protection Program Central Isotope Storage, home of gammacell irradiator</li>
	<li>24-038 Main Accumulation Area which has the 4 4 4 NFPA diamond on the exterior door </li>
	<li>16-039 temperature and humidity controlled flammable or biological radioactive waste storage room with that I once saw the inside of when facilities was checking for basement flooding.</li>
	<li>10-086 which is a room only accessible through a "telephone room" and whose purpose is VAULT and whose owner is Vice President for Finance. Apparently, the lounge above which also has a VAULT used to be the office where you collected your paycheck</li>
	<li>when 26-100 was last renovated, the handrails they bought were an inch too long to line up with the 4 bolt holes in the floor under each leg so they tossed the pallet of 36 railings in the back and bought new ones</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>For long-range planning, MIT is currently following the <a href="https://web.mit.edu/mit2030/">2030 Framework</a> which includes the <a href="https://web.mit.edu/mit2030/themes/renovation-renewal-stewardship/accelerated-capital-renewal.html">Accelerated Capital Renewal initiative (ACR)</a> priorities and the <a href="https://web.mit.edu/mit2030/projects/eastcampusgateway/index.html">East campus/Kendall gateway urban design study</a> with planning from 2009-2014 through construction into the 2020s. Funding for current construction is included in the Resource Development <a href="https://betterworld.mit.edu/">Campaign for a Better World</a> </li>
	<li>This is distinct from the previous <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030415002941/http://web.mit.edu/evolving/constructionmap.html">captial construction program</a> sparked by the 1998 Report of the Presidential Task Force on Student Life and Learning.
	</li>
	<li>Apparently MIT's first actual research sounding rocket was launched by Hale "the only person who wrote any documentation about what he did" Bradt and it had all the classic experiences: finding food near Las Cruces, trying to get a radioactive source approved, rain in the desert, jokes about leaving on the lens cap, a dozen people furiously working the day of the launch, having your weight wrong and needing to mount something differently at the launch site, getting something shipped from MIT last minute and it not arriving, etc. <a href="https://space.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Rocket_Diary_1967_0.pdf">(source)</a>
	</li>
	</ul>
