<h3>2022-05-14 - Carnegie Museum of Art</h3>
<p>I recently chaperoned my high school art club's trip to the museum which has all new exhibits since the last time I visited. Here are some thoughts:</p>
<h4>Working Thought</h4>
<p>
	The first piece I see is the one I was looking for by MIT graduate Tomashi Jackson who combines vibrant colors on top of photographs using relevant materials to highlight lived experiences. <br>
	<img src="img/cmoa_1.jpg"/><br>
	The first thing I notice in this depiction of the Johnstown Flood by Aaron Spangler is the use of pipes as an element in the overall Metropolis aesthetic. Perhaps unintentionally it showcases the irony of a city's destruction being caused by neglect of drainage infrastructure by a club comprised of railroad and steel elites who made their money selling infrastructure. <br> 
	<img src="img/cmoa_2.jpg"/><br>
	But otherwise, it's a fragile piece of infrastructure requiring small adjustments and maintenance - which helps explain why other works in the exhibit (Joe Minter) use wrenches as a primary element as opposed to other classes of found tools. <br><br>
	In the theme of maintenance, there's a film by Mierle Laderman Ukeles who I had  who is known for highlighting the maternal duties of "maintenance" as opposed to the masculine task of "creation". It documented the June 21, 1992 performance of a ballet of barges with recyclables and towboats in Pittsburgh. One viewing platform barge was given a recycled glass diamond; another barge had a ziggurat  of steel and aluminum; and the final barge had steel scraps. The two barges crossed between rivers then were "flopped". The towboats moved in choreographed circles in the Forks of the Ohio. Meanwhile, retired steelworkers performed choreographed movements in the Point State Park. <br><br>
	Towering up a wall are Moyra Davey's collection of decaying pennies photographed and individually mailed/put into circulation with a constellation of bright stickers. This series was sent to Carnegie because 1943 pennies were manufactured out of steel. <br>

<h4>Locally Sourced</h4>
<p>
	This collection of local craft creations includes a set of bowties by <a href="https://knotzland.com/">Knotzland</a> based on museum collections and historic homes so of course I needed to take a picture.<br>

</p>
<h4>Zoe Zenghelis: Fields, Fragments, Fictions</h4>
<p>
	After looking around for a while, I talk to a volunteer, a former math major and daughter of a physicist, about the exhibit. Based on talking and later reading the 38-page program, I note that Zoe Zenghelis' practice is dreamlike abstract colorful architecture informed by emotion rather than the traditional black and white pragmatic practice.<br>
	I love the vibrant minimal forms in her architectural paintings emphasizing the placement of important planes with its almost-computer-generated aesthetic (SimCity or Rollercoaster Tycoon). In particular, I enjoy the simplification to the essence of a landscape design in <em>Cassata after Parc de la Villette</em>.<br>

<h4>A Pittsburgh Anthology</h4>
<p>
	One is supposed to purchase a $15 binder from the gift shop then collect cards about local artworks from around each room. In addition, there are cards where one may write and leave behind or take stories of visits to Pittsburgh from other visitors. Some highlights include "We are exploring the museum and trying to be artsy." and "Where is the bathroom?".<br><br>
	One piece I enjoy is this proposal, Piers Project: Pittsburgh: Steel Object, for a sculpture mimicking the design of coal processing structures to be a centerpiece of reclaimed public space.<br>

<h4>Extraordinary Ordinary Things</h4>
<p>
	This collection of home furnishings is focused around a collection of chairs. One that catches my interest in particular is this piece by Frank Gehry, architect of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stata_Center">MIT Stata Center</a>.<br>
	<img src="img/cmoa_13.jpg"/><br>
	The exhibit also has tables with books such as <em>The Lucky, Plucky Chairs</em>, a short story about Thonet No.14 chairs written by the chairman of a chair company followed by a guide to popular chair designs.<br><br>
	Because of my Big Mouth Billy Bass ugly Christmas sweater, I am drawn to Achille Barbizet's <em>Monumental basin</em>, a kitschy piece of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palissy_ware">Rusticware</a>.<br>
	<img src="img/cmoa_14.jpg"/><br>
	Another area highlights women in the Bauhaus movement including this serving platted by pioneering industrial designer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belle_Kogan">Belle Kogan</a>.<br>
	<img src="img/cmoa_16.jpg"/><br>
	I also enjoy the simplicity of Jurgen Bey's <em>Gardening Bench</em>, a minimal blackbox device that extrudes a loaf of furniture.<br>

<h4>Crossroads: Carnegie Museum of Artâ€™s Collection, 1945 to Now</h4>
<p>
	An entire room contains only a set of artist Park McArthur's used CPAP filters and walls with printouts of mirrored spirometer gradations so it looks as though one is being measured. I appreciate the incorporation of the aesthetics of measurement along with the emphasized dynamic architecture of air.<br>
	<img src="img/cmoa_20.jpg"/><br>
	I am intrigued by Rachel Harrison's <em>Utopia</em>. On one side there's an explorer admiring a landscape and on the other there's a piece of fool's gold. The latter makes me think back to the book <em>River of Shadows: Eadweard Muybridge and the Technological Wild West</em> and the co-production of communication technology and artificiality.<br>
	<img src="img/cmoa_21.jpg"/><br>
	I sit for a while at the Martha Rosler film <em>A Budding Gourmet</em> but the volume is a little too low to pay full attention. It appears to be images of cookbooks (actually food magazines) with sarcastic monotonous storytelling of the constructed commodity that is a cuisine.<br><br>
	Finally, I reach a piece documenting long walks like my own. Land artist Richard Long's <em>Elterwater Stone Ring</em> is a collection of 113 stones each representing a walk through the town of Elterwater. I enjoy the conceptual archival objects documenting large quantities of labor as opposed to land art's left-behind marks of having walked.<br>
