<h3>French Drain Engineering (2022)</h3>
	<p>To divert water away from my downspout and prevent ponding in my yard and runoff into a driveway, I researched, measured, designed, procured, dug, placed, and tested a french drain system. The project ultimately required 24 hours of manual labor.</p>
	
	<p>A downspout could be extended with a simple shallow PVC pipe but to prevent ponding elsewhere, I went for an entire french drain installation with perforated pipe to allow excess groundwater to drain, a gravel trench to retain water in voids, a non-woven landscaping fabric to prevent grass roots and soil runoff from clogging. I also added a catch basin to collect water from a porch and landscaping bed. Conveniently, the end of my yard drops off abruptly to just the right height to have a 1% slope on the pipe from the catch basin.</p>
	<img src="img/large/drainplan1.jpg"/>
	<img src="img/large/drainplan2.jpg"/>
	
	<p>I began digging with a drain spade/sharpshooter shovel using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgRoxIzqLRI">this method</a> but ultimately decided to use a tiller instead. Due to my rocky soil, I needed to use a hammer 8 times to remove rocks stuck on the tines.</p>

<h3>Bean Counting Pi Day Pie (2022)</h3>
	<p> For pi day, I decided to bake a bean pie. I began by sorting and counting the contents of a bag of beans.
	<br><br>
	So, in summary, Hurst's HamBeens Cajun 15 BEAN SOUP contains 4646 plus or minus 64 beans. The ingredients list says contains 15 of 17 listed varieties.
	This batch contains 16 varieties - the two kidney varieties are combined on the ingredients list as "kidney". The two missing are yelloweye and "small white beans" which appears to be a term for the other white beans thrown in without being pre-sorted.
	<br><br>
	Errors are due to extrapolation by weighing [yellow pea and lentil have a systematic error from whiteish fragments and yellow fragments - and white kidney vs northern are hard to classify but that error doesn't change the total (it has covariance). Counts without uncertainty are exact, 0.5s are half-beans. Also split peas and lentils are called beans which the UN does not agree with - also split peas are half-peas so realistically one should halve the number.
	</p>
	<img src="img/large/beancounter.jpg"/>
	<p>
	I then picked out beans following the pattern: <br>
	3	navy<br>
	1	pinto<br>
	4	navy<br>
	1	cranberry<br>
	5	navy<br>
	9	pink<br>
	2	navy<br>
	6	small red<br>
	5	navy<br>
	3	dark kidney<br>
	5	navy<br>
	8	light kidney<br>
	9	navy<br>
	7	baby lima<br>
	9	navy<br>
	3	black<br>
	2	navy<br>
	3	white kidney<br>
	8	navy<br>
	4	northern<br>
	6	navy<br>
	2	pinto<br>
	... <br>
	until I arrived at 299 beans.
	</p>
	<img src="img/large/beanscounted.jpg"/>
	<p>
	Finally, I incorporated my tediously-counted beans into a <a href="https://tastecooking.com/recipes/bean-pie/"> bean pie recipe </a>.

<h3>Nuclear Unfolding (2021)</h3>
	<p> See <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~bowties/img/large/NA.pdf"> final review booklet</a> for background on our class.</p>
	<p> For a seminar proposing a virtual/augmented reality interactive artwork for the MIT Nuclear Reactor Lab, I devised an environment combining different layers of prompts requiring different perspectives of tacit knowledge in operating a nuclear physics experiment.</p>
	<p> This box is a tangible remnant of the idea of interactions with knobs from color-coded perspectives (vaguely associated with matters of concern, health, instability, & specialized knowledge).</p>

<h3>RF Receiver (2021)</h3>
	<p>This is direct conversion receiver tuned for a performance art project where volunteers hold a 500ft wire in the hollow interior of a helical ramp to the MBTA Alewife Station parking garage - forming an antenna with highest gain around 5-9MHz (up to highly uncertain measurement of building).</p>
	<p>The device has a rugged enclosure with BNC+SMA connections and a terminal block for accepting rugged 8AWG wiring (chosen so performers don't break it, also on sale at Home Depot).</p>
	<p>After looking at designs from MIT Lincoln Labs Cantenna and the MIT Haystack SRT, I decided to use the SA602A Mixer IC with local oscillator and input/output filtering designs from the datasheet. There is a superheterodyne output in one ear and a power level (from a peak detector) synthesized (with a voltage-controlled oscillator) into an audible output in the other. </p>

<h3>Edgerton Center Activities (2020-2021)</h3>

	<h4> Pinball Course </h4>
	<p> In January 2021, I was the TA for a pinball machine building class. I ultimately laser cut, 3D printed, and packaged parts for 25 kits. After tutorials on design for 3D printing, laser cutting, and vinyl cutting, we made+mailed out around 200 parts for students.</p>
	<p> You can have a look at the <a href="img/large/pinball_guide.pdf">assembly guide</a> and <a href="img/large/pinball_final.pdf">final presentations</a>.
	<br/>
	<img src="img/large/pinball_kits.jpg" alt="a beautiful work of art"/>
	<br/>
	<h4> CP* B*X Kit </h4>
	<p> I also worked on assembling 5000 14-piece <a href="https://edgerton.mit.edu/node/3020">engineering kits</a> for MIT Admissions - finding efficient ways to open and tape the tops of 5000 9V batteries, extract 5000 wire strippers from clamshell packaging, and to lay out an assembly line - and personally making around half - plus pictures for the instructions.</p>
	<br/>
	<img src="img/large/beaveralis.jpg" alt="a beautiful work of art"/>
	<br/>
	<h4> Muon Detector </h4>
	<p> In summer 2020, I virtually mentored a team of high schoolers in Barcelona to build a muon detector based off the Cosmic Watch project. Their initial idea was a Geiger counter, but, due to safety concerns, I reduced the maximum voltage being handled from 600V to ~25V</p>
	<p> Here is a Zoom screenhot of our first hint of evidence that the circuit was amplifying and extending pulses - and that they occurred at about the proper rate for the volume of scintillator.</p>

	<h4> Mentor Shirts </h4>
	<p> Before the pandemic, I learned to use a Cricut Maker by cutting our logo in different colors of iron-on vinyl before aligning and applying to shirts for all of our mentors. I also used a Brother CNC embroidery machine to put our names on them - along with testing Ink/Stitch for more complex shapes.</p>

	<h3>Dijet Physics (2020)</h3>
	<p> Once MIT went virtual, <a href="http://web.mit.edu/8.13/www/index.shtml">8.14</a> Experimental Physics II replaced the exploratory project with modern data analysis. My partner and I chose to work on the mystery of why jets observed in opposite directions emitted in relativistic heavy ion collisions happen to have very different momenta. 
	<br>Follow along with our <a href="img/large/814poster.pdf"> Poster </a>.<br>
	A number of models suggest this energy loss can be explained simply by the lengths at which each interacts through the quark-gluon plasma left behind. To test this hypothesis, one simulates Fermi-distributed circles with expected collision cross-sections colliding in order to calculate length anti-correlations. (I was also learning python for this, and my inefficient code couldn't handle the non-intersecting criterion used in most Glauber models so our distribution more clustered).<br>
	For each of our screened non-interacting jet pairs from PYTHIA, we choose a length pair based on the ATLAS centrality interval, and apply our energy loss. Then, after more screening, we look at the histogram of momentum ratios and the nuclear modification factor (ratio of lead jets to proton jets in a given energy bin - used to ensure energy loss is physical). We want to choose parameters and models that minimize the peak in the first histogram and maintain the flat ~0.5 ratio in the second as observed by ATLAS.<br>
	Something interesting occurs through pre-screening PYTHIA jets - which is that before interaction, they are more symmetric in energy than protons which we noticed the day before presentation.<br>
	Anyway, methods of statistically selecting energy loss, including a ratio of gluon creations between gluon and quark jets, and even branching momentum out then applying energy loss to the remaining lengths fail to produce the expected peak.<br>
	It is clear our minimization was not "robust" enough to handle the number of stochastic inputs (if applied energy loss is chosen around mean value calculated from parameters, one can easily step into low-statistics region; quantization sensitivities if branching from selecting whole number of branches).
	<br>
	Overall, our main insight was that purely deterministic path-length dependence is insufficient just as others have demonstrated.

<h3>Brandeised (2019)</h3>
	<p> Building off the themes Interspecies Communication and the Anthropocene, Brandeised is dialogue between historic case law and modern laundry tracking technology. Additionaly, the project was traced as a scientific investigation with the laboratory notebook shown alongside the piece. My pamphlet description is copied below. </p>

	<p>In 1908, Louis D. Brandeis, an overachieving Harvard Law graduate, delivered the first dossier of scientific evidence to the Supreme Court of the United States. In this case, Muller v. Oregon, a woman&#8217;s employer had been fined for making her work more than 10 hours – all due to a load of laundry. Brandeis argued to uphold the state&#8217;s fine based on scientific consensus about a woman&#8217;s physical abilities and role in society. The resulting decision marks an early attempt to regulate labor and move past the desire for ever increasing work in the industrialized world – all with morally questionable flaws.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>To fulfill the modern desire for efficiency, we have faced a number of ironies – none more apparent than the desire to launder our surroundings by pushing waste somewhere else.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>More alarmingly, we continue to facialize our world in a particular way. We see scientists and engineers on a journey towards infinite efficiency as we are presented with well-curated displays of progress rather than the haphazard laboratories behind. Worse, the most hidden of laboratories are in the early stages of tracking new critical zones – investigating runaway effects so that others may design a solution.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>So when does the face of a critical system become an extension of our species and our problem? The answer may continue from our scientific fantasy – when it achieves for us like a monkey in orbit or is surviving a crisis where corporations may appear to intervene like ducks in an oil spill. At most other times, the artist holds the role of spreading concern.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>Like Brandeis, our critical zone begins with a load of laundry. In particular, we observe the phenomenon of microfiber pollution – one of many unchecked sources of ubiquitous marine plastic. In our cybernetically-controlled monitoring lab, we see the efficiency-driven publically-accessible usage of washing machines at Brandeis&#8217;s namesake university. After tracing the battered fiber remnants through the sewer system, we emulate their spread and staining of the environment by metaphoric bubbles.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>This is Brandeis&#8217;s Laundry.</p>

	<h3>Quantization Physics (2019-2020)</h3>
<p>	In January 2019, I worked on <a href ="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4757-2063-1" >Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics</a> in the Physics Directed Reading Program to explore symplectic geometry and the algebraic structure of observables and symmetries as seen in this <a href ="https://phys-drp.mit.edu/sites/default/files/bowties.pdf" > presentation </a>.
	<br>
In January 2020, I continued with learning about the methods of <a href ="https://math.berkeley.edu/~alanw/GofQ.pdf" >Geometric Quantization</a>, an attempt to choose a self-consistent symmetry-preserving map between classical and quantum systems which is useful for Chern-Simons theory and qubits as seen in this <a href ="https://phys-drp.mit.edu/sites/default/files/bowties_0.pdf" > presentation</a>.
<br>
For my <a href="img/large/806paper.pdf"> 8.06 term paper </a>, I decided to explore the competing form of quantization known as deformation quantization or the phase space formulation. It was arrived at by two methods: simplifying Fourier transforms to do statistical mechanics and as a quantization to symmetrically treat position and momentum operators. By exponentiation operator representations of position and momentum and canonical commutation relations, it is possible to represent a dynamics using a distribution in the classical phase space rather than a representation of a Hilbert space given a representation of the quantized operators. The only requirement to do so is to deform the one-to-one correspondence of classical and quantum symmetries. The Wigner-Weyl transform is one method of doing so though others are used such as that by Roy Glauber to describe coherent states.

	<p> At one point I noticed an abundance of cereals being released which have no reason to exist - simply look at recent years in the <a href="https://www.mrbreakfast.com/cereal_timeline.asp"> Cereal Timeline </a>.
	<img src="img/large/cereal.jpg" alt="a beautiful work of art"/> <br>
	To keep track of these, I began a collection along with a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WV4VnuyxTWIXFKLsbqaLV7N6iYWdozo-UwfA0IlrCM8/edit?usp=sharing"> Spreadsheet </a> of my unscientific ratings. This expanded into an attempt to find correlations between base grain, percent sugar, price, and rating. <br>
	Ultimately, only qualitative conclusions can be made: I dislike corn and sugar has minimal impact unless over 40 percent - at which point the product is usually designed to mimic a sugary snack.

	<h3>Rocket Team Activities (2017-2018)</h3>
	<h4> Kalman Filter </h4>
	<p> On the avionics team, I worked on developing firmware in C++ using an extended Kalman filter to combine sensor values and an expected flight profile for "sensor fusion".
	<ul>
	<li>The rocket is spinning and not angled straight up, so we must use a separate Madgwick Filter to find, integrate z acceleration.</li>
	<li>Drag is a nonlinear force, so we must compute Jacobians from past measurements.</li>
	<li>Over Mach 1, the particular rocket design involves Prandtl-Meyer expansion fans which require a factor of 10 error on barometer reading.</li>
	<li>All data is simulated based on assumptions about mounting+weather as data logging has failed due to flash/battery issues in separate development cycle.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4> Dispersion Analysis </h4>
	<p>For an FAA Class 3 waiver, one must provide a map around the launch site confidence intervals where a rocket is expected to land with functioning/non-functioning parachutes, different wind conditions, and other factors such as launch angle. Typically, the workflow was to take motor data from BurnSim and aerodynamic profiles from RASAero and place them into a proprietary $1000 program to generate these graphs. Previously, an entire VM was used to run a Flask server to modify files and run them in OpenRocket. To replace this, I created a context menu to set mean & standard deviation for parameters, then run arbitrarily many (memory-limited) simulations with results appended to a csv file. </p>
	<h4> L1 Rocket </h4> <img src="img/large/rockets.jpg" alt="a beautiful work of art"/>
	<p>As with all Rocket Team members, I developed my clone of <a href="http://reilley.net/">Andrew Reilley</a>'s L1 Rocket (LOC-precision stock parts and laser-cut centering rings/fins simulated in OpenRocket). The following month, I produced another in under 2 hours. And the following year, I co-led the team build session.</p>
	
	<h4> Onion Andrew Rocket </h4>
	<p> When Andrew graduated, we replaced him with a character named Onion Andrew based on Homestar Runner character <a href="http://www.hrwiki.org/wiki/Onion_Bubs">Onion Bubs</a>. Eventually, in 2022, an iteration of Onion Andrew came into my possession and began rotting so I turned him into a rocket </p>

	<h4> Robot (2017) </h4>
	<p> Entry for PA-TSA Robotics with Jon Brown, Devin Fisher, Chase Toth. This is the only time I actually built a robot and as such it doesn't have a good name. It was finished at the last minute and no testing was done in the final field so it got stuck in the corner unable to pick up balls but it was still in the top 10 due to documentation.</p>

	<h4> Fresnel Distillation (2017) </h4>
	<p> A not-very-feasible idea for an entry for TSA Engineering Design - but I don't come up with ideas only implement and document them - so we decided to build a water purification system that involves directing sunlight to boil water then collecting the condensed vapor.</p>

	<h4> In Need of The Wright Training (2015) </h4>
	<p> This entry for TSA Children's Stories was about a bird learning to fly. You can go read it <a href="childrens_story.pdf">here</a>.</p>

	<p>Since you scrolled down, I'll give you some more details. My art teacher had purchased materials for fusing glass which sat for months with nobody attempting to use it. After testing with some simple details, I realized organic shapes carried over best and decided on a wet outdoor aesthetic. I realized that glass would allow a fountain to look more unteresting than my solid ceramic one in the past. I was also in a wire-sculpting phase so that forms the main structure.</p>

	<p>This recursive acronym which I built so my friend, Matt Popovnak, could cross "build a CNC machine" off his bucket list. The idea of linear of motion was easy to attain and so was mechanical construction. Reverse engineering the drifted PWM motor logic and driving took the most time. The system plots from a set of points to a resolution of 256x256 based not on stepper motors on encoders but on time. It begins with a calibration step measuring time from the origin to limit switches and back. Drift based on battery level causes significant error over time, resulting in offset drawings.</p>

	<p>For this weekly sketch book, I chose to focus on the fine details of my antique pencil sharpener collection. This piece features one of the widest ranges of value I have achieved.</p>

	<h3>Faith Sketch (2016)</h3>
	<p>For this sketchbook, I interpreted faith as that in ensuring my Lego space shuttle does not break while I draw it. For some reason, I though trying to accent regular patterns would be easier than abnormal ones, but instead mistakes are easier to see. Here, I mainly focused on proper relative perspective geometry. I'm not necessarily pursuing space exploration, but I've had this collecting dust in my room for years.</p>

	<p> This was the first in a steak of Pop-Art influenced drawings.</p>

	<h3>My Name's Not Matt (2016)</h3>
	<p> Acrylic on Paper</p>
	<p>On the first day of calculus, the teacher showed a magic square algorithm and a few examples students had made up to 57 x 57 all by students named Matt. Since Matt wasn't trying, I decided to work on a 63x63 one in Art Club. I decided to color in numbers of interest found via a C++ program I wrote: primes, twin primes, perfect squares, and powers of numbers who have more than one appearing.</p>

	<h3>La Mante Sur Le Mont (2016)</h3>
	<p>Pen/Ink</p><p>
Featured in Greater Johnstown Young Artists Exhibit 2016</p><p>
In the style of art nouveau, I attempted to abstract away the details of the intricate mantis shrimp, part of my pseudonym indicating an eclectic view, using curvilinear forms and emphasis of details (eyes compared to segments). I experimented with the idea of stippling across a symmetric border to draw attention to the contrast between a bright organism and its environment analogous to an underwater and "desert" setting. As a result, the floral forms were chosen near those appearing in both. The border was added to enclose each environment. There is no up.

	<h3>Time Dependence (2015)</h3>
	<p>Mixed Media</p><p>
Featured in Greater Johnstown Young Artists Exhibit 2015</p><p>
Allied Artists of Johnstown Achievement Award</p><p>
After a summer of teaching myself calculus, mechanics, and E&M, I needed to channel my interests into something. So I chose my Crafts I strip­build pot. Yes, I enjoyed electronics, placing real components and proudly displaying Maxwell's equations on the front. I did not test the glazes, so the 1 k ohm resistors do not appear to be so. (My favorite 330ohm are fine.)</p>

	<h3>Seahorse (2015)</h3>
	<p>Rice Paper Batik</p><p>
Featured at MIT Campus Preview Weekend</p><p>
Because of snow and an unexpected artist in residence, I had 3 days to complete this project in class. After repeating a cut paper design and transferring it into the bounds of a freehanded seahorse, I began applying the wax. When the fountain pen tipped, I managed to spill out a "sea spirit" on the right. It's good to know I'm haunted. Anyway, I became carried away with realism, as usual, adding a background with schools of fish and the sun.

	<h3>Music Box (2015)</h3>
	<p>Entry for PA-TSA Electronic Research & Experimentation<br>
	This music box combined synthesizers and pre-programmed hits such as:<br>
<em>Take Me Out To The Ballgame<br>
Oh My Darling, Clementine<br>
Korobeiniki/Tetris Theme<br>
Battle Hymn of the Republic<br>
Yankee Doodle<br>
and the Ievan Polka</em><br>
- I hand-transcribed sheet music to durations and "numbered keys on a piano" [correcting for key signatures] which are actively converted to PWM frequencies <br>
- a bar graph would light up corresponding to the pitch being played <br>
- one could switch off/on the synthesizers and pre-programmed songs <br>
- the audio output uses a separate power supply <br>
- some bits are soldered to a perfboard <br>
- do not look too closely at this schematic <br>

	<h3>Bowtie Holder (2015)</h3>
	<p>Wood, Nails, Acrylic</p>
	<p>Upon acquiring my 9th bowtie, I realized their loose ends called for a compact storage location, so I set out to manufacture a custom solution to hang with my clothes and allow me to store even more, so I did. I now have 36 but can only fit 12 so now it holds greeting cards.</p>

	<h3>Microcosm (2014)</h3>
	<p>Drawing</p><p>
Featured in Greater Johnstown Young Artists Exhibit 2014</p><p>
When instructed to produce a five­point perspective piece, my first instinct was a colony of bacteria under a microscope lens, however I had no idea the roles they would lead in their society, so I rose an order of magnitude and decided to place orders of magnitude arbitrarily branching out of each other.</p>

	<h3>Mr. Stick Comics (2009-2011)</h3>
	<p>I've collected some of them <a href="img/large/stick.pdf">here</a>. I doodled these in my free time and even published on in the school newspaper (which was a once-a-year publication from the Gifted Support class). There are 90 but I'm self-conscious of my dumb jokes, cultural parodies, and gratuitous violence so here's a few that demonstrate my pondering of tunnels and humor. </p> </figcaption>
