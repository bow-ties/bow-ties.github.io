		<h1>Destiny History Timeline</h1>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="back">
	<p> Destiny is the living group comprising the first floor of the 282 side of the MIT dorm <a href="http://web.mit.edu/random-hall/www/">Random Hall</a> at 282-290 Massachusetts Avenue in Cambridge, MA. The dorm is MIT's smallest with a capacity of 93. It is associated with characteristic east side culture (along with East Campus and the former dorms Senior House and Bexley). Destiny can hold 10 and is often combined with the 3 residents of neighboring floor, Foo. With so few residents, our culture changes quickly from year to year.
	</p>
	<p>
	We spend most of our time in our kitchen with its consist of 4 tables, many chairs, a couch, a floor TV, and 4 fridges giving us the highest fridge-to-resident ratio. Historically, our lounge with bi-level stadium seating was a popular gathering place. Our lounge closet used to be a server room but is now mostly resident storage. 
	</p>
	<p>This is a timeline of known events in and around our community - curated for the internet historian. I've included external/Random events that are related to Destiny but not those with no direct connection like The Milk.</p>

		<h2> Circa 1888 </h2>	
			<h3>Random Constructed</h3>					
				<p> Between <a href="https://www.cambridgema.gov/TheWorks/documents/str-14-01.jpg">1887</a> and <a href="https://www.cambridgema.gov/TheWorks/documents/sew-15-34.jpg">1891</a>, the marshland south of present day Front Street is sold by the estate of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Henry_Dana_Jr.">Richard Henry Dana Jr.</a> to US Bicycle Patentholder <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Augustus_Pope"> Albert A. Pope</a> and his associates, H.D. Hyde & G.T.W. Braman of the Cambridge Street Railway. The group construct, in 1892-1896, a bicycle/"velocipedal" racetrack on the other side of Lansdowne operating as the Cambridge Field Company. 
				</p>
				<p> 
				In 1894, Pope and Qunicy architect/lumber dealer Stephen O. Moxon receive <a href="https://wayback.archive-it.org/5488/20170330145550/http://hul.harvard.edu/lib/archives/refshelf/cba/m.html"> building permit 4439</a> to construct a 4-story building at 40 Front Street (282-290 Massachusetts Avenue) - Moxon would go on to build the apartments behind in 1895.
				</p>
				<p>
				Random Hall is possibly the oldest building in MIT's collection being built before MIT itself moved to Cambridge (1894, bought 1967) - and only competes with the <a href="https://www.cambridgema.gov/-/media/Files/historicalcommission/pdf/chcmeetingfiles/D1585_memo.pdf">Metropolitan Storage Warehouse</a> (W41) (built 1894-1895, bought 1962).

		<h2> 1968-02-29 to 1970-06-12 </h2>	
			<h3>Random Opens</h3>
			
				<p>
				In <a href="https://thetech.com/issues/87/47/pdf">September 1967</a>, the institute had 60 students in overcrowded dorm rooms, 100 in overflow apartments, and was expecting to lose 90 beds to renovations. 300 beds were planned for MacGregor which would be constructed over the next two years. MIT's temporary solution was to purchase a derelict apartment building at 282-290 Massachusetts Avenue as overflow housing.
				</p>
				<p>Trademarked names like Maxwell House and Random House are rejected. Random Hall is chosen to be named after J. Arthur Random. See origin story <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060430130835/http://web.mit.edu/random-hall/www/history.html">emails<a/> (these are also in the random-hall athena locker).
				</p>
				<p>
				In 1970, MacGregor finally opened and Random was removed as a housing option.

		<h3> Laundry Server v1 </h3>
			<p>The original laundry server is built as a 6.111 project (we know because of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20031202104411/http://web.jfet.org/pdf/nytimes-laundry-bathroom.pdf">article</a> featuring v2) by Phil Lisiecki and Kevin Lynch (photo via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990117012908/http://www.mit.edu/people/cldavias/home.html">here</a>.). The first archived <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970208073310/http://spleen.mit.edu/LAUNDRY/index.html">version</a> is hosted in 1997 on spleen.mit.edu by Jacob Schwartz (quark), the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991013134944/http://spleen.mit.edu/ok.html">OK</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970208073738/http://spleen.mit.edu/ok3.html">soda</a> guy.

			<h3>Donut Floor</h3>
				<p>	“The first floor is one of three all male floors in Random Hall. Famous for their coffee and Dunkin Donut study breaks, they are sometimes referred to as "Donut Floor." They are proud to house "The Youngest Student at MIT," and you may even be able to visit with him during Rush, if his busy schedule permits.” - via Rush <a href="https://web.mit.edu/random-hall/construction/www/rush/empire.html">website</a>.</p>

				<p>The Bylaws are updated to ban "shafting" i.e. dropping glass objects from the roof.</p>
				<p> Previously, the rules were </p>
				<ul>
					<li>NEVER shaft anything organic.</li>
					<li>Do not shaft entire recycling bins of glass bottles; in general, shaft only bottles you finished.</li>
					<li>Shaft only in the 282 shaft.</li>
					<li>Do not shaft Course 6 students (not technically organic, but they still smell bad)</li>

			<h3> Bathroom and Laundry Server v2 </h3>
				<p>Jim Paris <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20031202104411/http://web.jfet.org/pdf/nytimes-laundry-bathroom.pdf">rebuilds</a> the laundry server in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010926025542/http://laundry.mit.edu/">format</a> that functions through 2013 mostly repaired by Destiny. The next <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108073908/http://laundry.mit.edu/">iteration</a> is hosted on a Raspberry Pi with interfaces housed in Sparkfun boxes. It ran 2013-2018 until IS&amp;T sold our IP address and nobody re-registered it. It implements text messaging by spam-emailing the number at all the common carriers' text-by-email addresses. It also logged indefinitely all of the active requests every time the status changed. As of April 3, 2018, there were 73 unique users making 465 requests.
				</p>
				<p>
				In summer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001018065224/http://web.mit.edu/raffik/www/professional.html">1999</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010402003133/http://bathroom.mit.edu/">bathroom</a> server is first installed, first detecting lights in bathrooms then with magnetic interlocks. The idea is by Shannon Cheng and implemented/hosted by people including Riad Wahby. In 2001, it is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010925174004/http://bathroom.mit.edu/">rebuilt</a> by Jim Paris and other Foo/Destiny/fort-awesome residents. This is also maintained by Destiny through until 2018 when taken offline. The Power Over Ethernet cables still run from a switch in the music room to every bathroom door where the wires are torn and sensors are falling off. The original beige monstrosity is sitting in the EE lab with a sticky note.

Ignoring all of the employee's recommendations, Destiny purchases a plethora of fish with fun names like Mark Suckerberg, Flavor-blasted pizza, and Nrdafiy Chikmk (who named themself by swimming to letters). Ultimately, the fish eat eachother and the tank remained empty - though running. In 2017, I placed my animatronic Big Mouth Billy Bass, Billy, into the tank. I cleaned the rust before the summer when the tank was placed in the trunk room where it remains today. In the photo, you can see Billy, Ken Bone, and the letters nrdafiy used to name itself.</p>

				<p> Team <a href="https://maslab.mit.edu/2016/wiki/team03">Skrub Wreckers</a> wins Mobile Autonomous Systems LAB IAP course along with the "Most Likely to Be Future Staff" award. This is exactly how it goes with barely anyone outside Destiny volunteering in the coming years. Fun fact: MASLAB supplies were located in a random IS&amp;T closet in Stata as instructed by the department space manager - until IS&amp;T started taking back closets and most supplies were thrown away. As a result the master set of keys dating back to before Stata are all useless.

				When running MASLAB in 2018, Andrew receives a delivery from D.E.Shaw the day after the competition with 288 each of S,M,L,&amp;XL sweatpants and wireless bluetooth speakers - you'll see them around campus from time to time.

			<h3> The Dishwasher </h3>
				<p>I've combined a few stories into this date. Our dishwasher is on wheels and requires a connector on the hose and an adapter on the faucet - and a non-tripped thermal fuse to operate.
				</p>
				<p>In 2017, the connector was slipping off the faucet so Destiny submitted an unanswered work request. Ultimately they took one from the basement dishwasher but had hypothesized epoxying the connector on and submitting another request named "Can't get it off".
				</p>
				<p>In 2018, the thermal fuse blew. I submitted a work request with a link to order the part instructions on how to replace it. In the meantime, I shorted the fuse with a cheap stretch of wire from a $1 multimeter probe. The appliance repair people who showed up weeks later received no information but "look at the dishwasher" and concluded it was running properly and left.</p>
				<p>In 2019, the mixing valve in our faucet broke so MIT bought an entirely new faucet and threw away the dishwasher adapter. The house mechanic, Tim, tried multiple parts but ultimately MIT solved the problem by buying us a new dishwasher compatible with the newer faucet adapters. On pi day 2019, before using the new dishwasher, I tried to steam an aluminum-wrapped hotdog in it.

					<li>2% Milk​ - we calculated that one could become 2% milk by drinking about 6 cups so we decided it should be an event</li>
					<li>Grocery Store Scavenger Hunt​ - we joked about how these events are funded so we decided to request cash to spend on our groceries under the guise of a scavenger hunt. One person showed up so we sent them to Target for bananas. </li>
					<li>Mario Kart and Wings​ - Continuing the trend since 2007 of Math &amp; Tea, Physics &amp; Fizzes, Chemistry &amp; Cake, Biology &amp; Brownies, CS &amp; Juice, etc. in which one gives talks while embezzling foods, we decided for wings. Ultimately, we watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpk2tdsPh0A">Watch for Rolling Rocks - 0.5x A Presses</a> and WingsOver Somerville canceled our first oversized order so our wings arrived late.</li>
					<li>Spiciest Memes - whatever we're doing in the kitchen</li>
					<li>Contemporary Art & Charcuterie - an event by me which shows performance <a href="https://vimeo.com/46293876">art</a> after I embezzle large quantities of meat and cheese. </li>
				</ul>
				<p>Former REX and CPW events include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>FRYday - every few years - we put random items in our deep fryer. Years ago, it was a Friday tradition. </li>
					<li>Rockets (and Ramen) - 2017/18 construction using an Estes Designer special kits from Rocket Team lab; no launching allowed.</li>
					<li>Sprite - 2017 - it's actually Crystal Pepsi in the bottle.</li>
					<li>(Almost) Life-Size Settlers of Catan - when Destiny played this so much we built a map into a table, we ran this event 2010-2017</li>
					<li>Chainmail - ran 2009-2015, sometimes "and Cheese"; supplies from the <a href="https://theringlord.com/">The Ring Lord</a> are in our closet</li>
					<li>Nacho Average Nachos - 2015</li>
					<li>Spooky Scary Videogames - 2015</li>
					<li>Mario Kart - various years</li>

				<p>"3. Undergraduates should not return to campus after spring break." - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200310231840/https://news.mit.edu/2020/letter-regarding-escalating-response-covid-19-0310">A significant new step in response to Covid-19</a></p>
				<p>
				Everyone is forced to vacate campus while all activities move online - mostly to Zoom and Discord. CPW is canceled for CP* and REX becomes Exploring Support Communities part of Support CommUnities For First Years - events are poorly attended and little interaction is had between upperclass students and first years until coming to campus in Spring 2021 when still limited to one's own dorm and in many cases to a max size 6 pod whilst many upperclass students had moved off-campus. Seniors are allowed in the Fall and everyone else in the Spring (up to Student Housing Assistance Review Process requests). Campus access is limited to residents with biweekly testing and daily attestations and a sense of unwelcome to explore meaning most first years haven't been down the Infinite Corridor and have no sense of building numbers or the culture of other dorms.
				</p>
				<p>
				To prevent any transmission, kitchens are closed except for microwaves and fridges so every student requires a mealplan. In the Fall, Random has a Bon Appetit setup in Foo for dinner and weekend brunch while breakfast and lunch are long lines at the Student Center. In the Spring, Restaurant Associates serves breakfast, lunch, dinner, and weekend brunch in Foo. Typical free food events are canceled. There are also 82 Tim the Beaver signs reminding students to wear masks and social distance.

			<h3>Pod Lounge</h3>
				<p>112 is opened as a "Pod Lounge" assigned to our Destiny pod for maskless interaction in the former <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/kevins-room/">Kevin's room</a>. We recreate the kitchen a few feet over but now with windows facing Mass Ave. We stole chairs out of the adjacent room where common area furniture was tetrised and out of the basement to fill in the room. For a while, we'd imagined buying a Belshaw-Adamatic Donut Robot Mark VI for hypothetical restaurant "Dunking Donuts", so when someone arrived in front of the window, we refer to it as "at Dunking" and we send receipts to anyone who talks through the window.
				We also keep the TV running with a Discord bot to queue videos.</p>
