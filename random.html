<h3>2024-01-01 - MIT Institutional Knowledge and Fun Historical Facts</h3>

<h4>Environment, Health, and Safety</h4>
	<b>1949</b> - MIT hires a safety officer (Main history <a href="https://news.mit.edu/1999/safety-0929">source</a> - this article also mentions mustard gas, jet fuel incidents)
	<br><b>1965</b> - Cambridge Electron Accelerator Fire led to on-call program and safety procedures for minors (fun aside on the CEA is this quote from MIT Physics donor Virgil Elings's thesis: "[Prof. Louis Osbourne's technical assistant, William] Lobar's unselfish assistance in rescuing the data during the explosion at the Cambridge Electron Accelerator is deeply appreciated")
	<br><b>1972</b> - A physics grad student, <a href="https://www.labsafety.org/memorial-wall">Shri Krishna Singh</a>, is electrocuted leading to MIT's first OSHA inspection. 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OSHA inspections of 30 buildings discover "unchained gas cylinders, step ladders with broken, steps, vacuum pumps and other mechanical equipment with unprotected belts and pulleys, bicycles chained in stairways, improper temporary wiring, exposed high-voltage wiring or components, and generally cluttered halls" <a href="https://thetech.com/issues/92/50/pdf">(source)</a>.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MIT asks DLCs to appoint <b>safety coordinators</b>. <a href="https://dome.mit.edu/handle/1721.3/59054">(source)</a> who eventually conduct annual inspections
	<br><b>1975</b> - Due to the Clean Water Act, MIT's hazardous waste contractor loses its ocean-dumping permit leading MIT to struggle to locate a contractor to incinerate or bury diverse small-quantity wastes. <a href="https://dome.mit.edu/handle/1721.3/59055">(source)</a>, <a href="https://dome.mit.edu/handle/1721.3/59056">(source)</a>
	<br><b>1986</b> - MIT must submit a <b>chemical inventory</b> annually to the Local Emergency Planning Committee as a result of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 Title III: Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act
	<br><b>1987</b> - OSHA <b>Hazard Communication</b> Program is extended from manufacturing to all industries; a Hazard Communication Plan and training on reading a MSDS is required. [29 CFR 1910.1200 "Hazard Communication."]'
	<br><b>1990</b> - Each DLC must have a <b>Chemical Hygeine Plan</b> annually renewed by the Chemical Hygiene Officer  [29 CFR 1910.1450 "Occupational exposure to hazardous chemicals in laboratories."] 
	<br><b>1998</b> - EPA inspection occurs; Findings include 18 violations of Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is found that MIT "Violated federal hazardous waste emergency, storage, handling and labeling regulations. Violations were found in 56 of 114 laboratories inspected...Failed to keep an opacity monitor on its medical waste incinerator in working order and violated several reporting requirements relating to the use of fuels in MIT's power plant...Did not have an adequate and fully implemented oil spill prevention plan." 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is considered "middle of the pack" for research universities. (<a href="https://www.epa.gov/archive/epapages/newsroom_archive/newsreleases/53ef1969f9e8bc9d8525742400029be7.html">source</a>) (<a href="https://thetech.com/issues/121/19/pdf">source</a>)

<h4>The internals of MITx Online / Open edX:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The server looks at a json configuration file pointing to courses along with start/end date info. The server finds the `course`s which are xml files in a `course` folder and a json file in the `policy` folder which defines assignment categories and their weights.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The `course` contains `chapter`s which contain `html`s and `sequential`s which contain `html`s and `vertical`s which contain `html`s and `problem`s which contain `html`s and `Response`s/`Solution`s which both contain `html`s. At any point these can be written directly in the xml file or included with a url attribute which is resolved in the chapter, sequential, vertical, problem, or html folders. Historically, one could use subfolders and colons in the url attribute but that practice has been deprecated in favor of very long filenames...
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A `sequential` has an assigned grading category. A `problem` has an assigned number of points, attempts, and relative weights. The `Response`s have assigned points and can be of many types including `FormulaResponse`, `NumericalResponse`, and `CustomResponse`.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`FormulaResponse`s grade by substituting values for each allowed variable in both the expected and students' responses. The range of values to check and number of samples are configurable. This leads to some edge cases if say a variable is always sampled as 2 or the expected answer is indistinguishable from zero or an expression becomes undefined unless simplified. `NumericalResponse`s allow a tolerance, partial credit, and a range. `CustomResponse`s allow you to assign points from a javascript or python script.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In principle, the entire course can be a single xml file or a policy.json file that overrides every attribute.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A common setup for edX is to pull code from a live branch of a git repository to publish to students and also pull from a staging branch to a separate staging site for testing. By using the git integration, changes made in the edX Studio interface will be overridden. Before pushing code, one should check for errors using edx-cleaner from the <a href="https://github.com/jolyonb/olxcleaner">olxcleaner</a> package. Fun fact: if you set an assignment date to one which does not exist like February 29th, the server's parser will error out and the rest of your course will fail to import. This will not be logged.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively, one could use the edX Studio interface which will generate xml files with garbled names which are hard to reuse between courses without copy/pasting from the inconsistent Studio interface with different views for 'html's and 'problem's or the "staff debug info" button which will dump the raw xml.

<h4>Other technology upgrades:</h4>
	<b>1999 - 2006</b>, Microsoft committed $25,000,000 to fund technology-based education projects at MIT through the <a href="https://icampus.mit.edu"/>iCampus</a> initiative: Technology Enabled Active Learning (TEAL), the iCampus / MIT Online Assessment Tool (iMoat) used for the Freshman/First-year Essay Evaluation over a decade later, XTutor (a precursor to catsoop and MITx answer checkers) and the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/fluids-modules/www/">School-wide Modular Program on Fluid Mechanics</a>. Related projects are in this <a href="https://web.mit.edu/edtech/projects/gallery.html">galley</a>.
	<br><b>2011</b> - transcripts digitized from <a href="https://itgc.mit.edu/system/files/FY12%20Ed%20System%20Roadmap%20update.pdf"> microfiche</a>
	<br><b>2011</b> - digitize admissions
	<br><b>2012</b> - registration digitized instead of on paper
	<br><b>2012</b> - online grade submission
	<br><b>2014</b> - digital add/drop form

<h4>Research Funding:</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>MIT is assigned to the Office of Naval Research as its Cognizant Agency (<a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-2/subtitle-A/chapter-II/part-200/appendix-Appendix%20III%20to%20Part%20200">as more funds were from the DOD than HHS in the previous years</a>). is the , the indirect cost rates (those which cannot be attributed to a specific research project i.e. 50-75% <a href="https://ras.mit.edu/rates/federal-research-facilities-and-administrative-fa-rates">Facilities and Administration</a> and 10% education)</li>
	<li>Internal audits every 3-4 years (arose in the 80s from fear of fines that scale - the funding agency will audit some fraction then extrapolate to a lump sum - "Stanford had the yacht", Harvard house renovation, faculty at Duke: "you can't suspend my procurement card - I'll lose my gym membership")</li>
	<li>Physics handles ~40 non-government grants and ~230 grad student appointments</li>
	</ul>

<h4>Mailing Lists:</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Mailing lists can be managed here: <a href="https://groups.mit.edu/webmoira/">https://groups.mit.edu/webmoira/</a> ; be sure to use Moira lists rather than mailman unless you really need anonymity/moderation. 
	<li>To unsubscribe from a mailman list, simply visit "https://mailman.mit.edu:444/mailman/options/some-mailman-list-you-are-on/your-kerberos@mit.edu" </li>
	<li>It is possible to send as a mailing list (or as anything@mit.edu but you'll only get replies if the mailing list forwards to you) via <a href="http://kb.mit.edu/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=5898573">this method</a>. Note this still leaves your athena login in the email headers. </li>
	<li>More advanced functions can be done via <a href="https://debathena.mit.edu/manpages/www/manpages/lucid/man1/blanche.1.html">blanche</a></li>
	</ul>


<h4>Miscellany:</h4>
	<ul>
	<li> Once committed to MIT, you receive an Infinite Connection ID to make an account at https://alum.mit.edu/ . Until around 2020, the home address on your application was publicly available on the alumni directory even if you had yet to create an account.</li>
	<li>Some fun rooms:
	<ul>
	<li>6-017, Radiation Protection Program Central Isotope Storage, home of gammacell irradiator</li>
	<li>24-038 Main Accumulation Area which has the 4 4 4 NFPA diamond on the exterior door </li>
	<li>16-039 temperature and humidity controlled flammable or biological radioactive waste storage room with that I once saw the inside of when facilities was checking for basement flooding.</li>
	<li>10-086 which is a room only accessible through a "telephone room" and whose purpose is VAULT and whose owner is Vice President for Finance. Apparently, the lounge above which also has a VAULT used to be the office where you collected your paycheck</li>
	<li>when 26-100 was last renovated, the handrails they bought were an inch too long to line up with the 4 bolt holes in the floor under each leg so they tossed the pallet of 36 railings in the back and bought new ones</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>For long-range planning, MIT is currently following the <a href="https://web.mit.edu/mit2030/">2030 Framework</a> which includes the <a href="https://web.mit.edu/mit2030/themes/renovation-renewal-stewardship/accelerated-capital-renewal.html">Accelerated Capital Renewal initiative (ACR)</a> priorities and the <a href="https://web.mit.edu/mit2030/projects/eastcampusgateway/index.html">East campus/Kendall gateway urban design study</a> with planning from 2009-2014 through construction into the 2020s. Funding for current construction is included in the Resource Development <a href="https://betterworld.mit.edu/">Campaign for a Better World</a> </li>
	<li>This is distinct from the previous <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030415002941/http://web.mit.edu/evolving/constructionmap.html">captial construction program</a> sparked by the 1998 Report of the Presidential Task Force on Student Life and Learning.
	</li>
	<li>Apparently MIT's first actual research sounding rocket was launched by Hale "the only person who wrote any documentation about what he did" Bradt and it had all the classic experiences: finding food near Las Cruces, trying to get a radioactive source approved, rain in the desert, jokes about leaving on the lens cap, a dozen people furiously working the day of the launch, having your weight wrong and needing to mount something differently at the launch site, getting something shipped from MIT last minute and it not arriving, etc. <a href="https://space.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Rocket_Diary_1967_0.pdf">(source)</a>

<h3>2022-05-14 - Carnegie Museum of Art</h3>
<p>I recently chaperoned my high school art club's trip to the museum which has all new exhibits since the last time I visited. Here are some thoughts:</p>
<h4>Working Thought</h4>
<p>
	The first piece I see is the one I was looking for by MIT graduate Tomashi Jackson who combines vibrant colors on top of photographs using relevant materials to highlight lived experiences. <br>
	<img src="img/cmoa_1.jpg"/><br>
	The first thing I notice in this depiction of the Johnstown Flood by Aaron Spangler is the use of pipes as an element in the overall Metropolis aesthetic. Perhaps unintentionally it showcases the irony of a city's destruction being caused by neglect of drainage infrastructure by a club comprised of railroad and steel elites who made their money selling infrastructure. <br> 
	<img src="img/cmoa_2.jpg"/><br>
	But otherwise, it's a fragile piece of infrastructure requiring small adjustments and maintenance - which helps explain why other works in the exhibit (Joe Minter) use wrenches as a primary element as opposed to other classes of found tools. <br><br>
	In the theme of maintenance, there's a film by Mierle Laderman Ukeles who I had  who is known for highlighting the maternal duties of "maintenance" as opposed to the masculine task of "creation". It documented the June 21, 1992 performance of a ballet of barges with recyclables and towboats in Pittsburgh. One viewing platform barge was given a recycled glass diamond; another barge had a ziggurat  of steel and aluminum; and the final barge had steel scraps. The two barges crossed between rivers then were "flopped". The towboats moved in choreographed circles in the Forks of the Ohio. Meanwhile, retired steelworkers performed choreographed movements in the Point State Park. <br><br>
	Towering up a wall are Moyra Davey's collection of decaying pennies photographed and individually mailed/put into circulation with a constellation of bright stickers. This series was sent to Carnegie because 1943 pennies were manufactured out of steel. <br>

</p>	
<h4>Locally Sourced</h4>
<p>
	This collection of local craft creations includes a set of bowties by <a href="https://knotzland.com/">Knotzland</a> based on museum collections and historic homes so of course I needed to take a picture.<br>
	<img src="img/cmoa_7.jpg"/>
</p>
<h4>Zoe Zenghelis: Fields, Fragments, Fictions</h4>
<p>
	After looking around for a while, I talk to a volunteer, a former math major and daughter of a physicist, about the exhibit. Based on talking and later reading the 38-page program, I note that Zoe Zenghelis' practice is dreamlike abstract colorful architecture informed by emotion rather than the traditional black and white pragmatic practice.<br>
	I love the vibrant minimal forms in her architectural paintings emphasizing the placement of important planes with its almost-computer-generated aesthetic (SimCity or Rollercoaster Tycoon). In particular, I enjoy the simplification to the essence of a landscape design in <em>Cassata after Parc de la Villette</em>.<br>
	<img src="img/cmoa_9.jpg"/>
</p>
<h4>A Pittsburgh Anthology</h4>
<p>
	One is supposed to purchase a $15 binder from the gift shop then collect cards about local artworks from around each room. In addition, there are cards where one may write and leave behind or take stories of visits to Pittsburgh from other visitors. Some highlights include "We are exploring the museum and trying to be artsy." and "Where is the bathroom?".<br><br>
	One piece I enjoy is this proposal, Piers Project: Pittsburgh: Steel Object, for a sculpture mimicking the design of coal processing structures to be a centerpiece of reclaimed public space.<br>
	<img src="img/cmoa_12.jpg"/>
</p>	
<h4>Extraordinary Ordinary Things</h4>
<p>
	This collection of home furnishings is focused around a collection of chairs. One that catches my interest in particular is this piece by Frank Gehry, architect of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stata_Center">MIT Stata Center</a>.<br>
	<img src="img/cmoa_13.jpg"/><br>
	The exhibit also has tables with books such as <em>The Lucky, Plucky Chairs</em>, a short story about Thonet No.14 chairs written by the chairman of a chair company followed by a guide to popular chair designs.<br><br>
	Because of my Big Mouth Billy Bass ugly Christmas sweater, I am drawn to Achille Barbizet's <em>Monumental basin</em>, a kitschy piece of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palissy_ware">Rusticware</a>.<br>
	<img src="img/cmoa_14.jpg"/><br>
	Another area highlights women in the Bauhaus movement including this serving platted by pioneering industrial designer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belle_Kogan">Belle Kogan</a>.<br>
	<img src="img/cmoa_16.jpg"/><br>
	I also enjoy the simplicity of Jurgen Bey's <em>Gardening Bench</em>, a minimal blackbox device that extrudes a loaf of furniture.<br>
	<img src="img/cmoa_18.jpg"/>
</p>	
<h4>Crossroads: Carnegie Museum of Art’s Collection, 1945 to Now</h4>
<p>
	An entire room contains only a set of artist Park McArthur's used CPAP filters and walls with printouts of mirrored spirometer gradations so it looks as though one is being measured. I appreciate the incorporation of the aesthetics of measurement along with the emphasized dynamic architecture of air.<br>
	<img src="img/cmoa_20.jpg"/><br>
	I am intrigued by Rachel Harrison's <em>Utopia</em>. On one side there's an explorer admiring a landscape and on the other there's a piece of fool's gold. The latter makes me think back to the book <em>River of Shadows: Eadweard Muybridge and the Technological Wild West</em> and the co-production of communication technology and artificiality.<br>
	<img src="img/cmoa_21.jpg"/><br>
	I sit for a while at the Martha Rosler film <em>A Budding Gourmet</em> but the volume is a little too low to pay full attention. It appears to be images of cookbooks (actually food magazines) with sarcastic monotonous storytelling of the constructed commodity that is a cuisine.<br><br>
	Finally, I reach a piece documenting long walks like my own. Land artist Richard Long's <em>Elterwater Stone Ring</em> is a collection of 113 stones each representing a walk through the town of Elterwater. I enjoy the conceptual archival objects documenting large quantities of labor as opposed to land art's left-behind marks of having walked.<br>

<div class="boxitem" id="2022-04-17 - Canon">
<h3>2022-04-17 The Canonization Manifesto: A Hypothetical Architecture Thesis</h3>			

<p>
<strong>Canon</strong>ization is any of a number of emergent phenomena whereby an abundance of knowledge is filtered into <strong>canon</strong>ical narratives especially those encountered in a field of knowledge production. Wishing to emphasize the plural and coexisting nature of <strong>canon</strong>s, note that, at every scale, individuals appear to filter and fit each piece of knowledge they come across into a personal narrative or head-<strong>canon</strong>. Due to this constant reinterpretation, describing the behavior of emergent unified narratives at a macroscopic level has led to many terms scattered across the fields of knowledge production. Thus I seek to perform some mathematics - once described as "the art of giving the same name to different things".
<br><br>
	Rather than proposing a theoretical framework around <strong>canon</strong>ization, my practice aims simply to aggregate perspectives that may be useful for studying their general role in the trans-disciplinary field of knowledge production consisting of art, science, design, engineering, craft, and surely others - as described by artists, philosophers, art historians, science historians, art critics, ethnographers, media ethnographers, anthropologists, sociologists, urban planners, psychologists, science technology and society scholars, practitioners in these fields, pedagogy researchers, outsiders, public perceptions, etc.
<br><br>
Some <strong>canon</strong>ical narratives are intimately shaped by epistemologies - systems of verification, belief, and trust. These systems define the extent to which one outsources belief to others' narratives. These are particularly significant for looking at modernity since the Enlightenment as technology has consisted of more and more layers of abstract thinking. These are based on models one may call molecular or nuclear whose unraveling far exceed an individual's comprehension. In that sense, these are ways of grappling with the need to develop <strong>canon</strong>ical narratives to live with an increasingly cyborgian existence.
<br><br>
Other <strong>canon</strong>ical narratives rely on ontologies - systems of definition and understanding. These systems attempt to address questions of scale and scope - what constitutes the physical extent of an object and how far into an infinite regression of abstract or virtual properties and relationships one ought to consider. Related are critical frameworks which are <strong>canon</strong>ical narratives one temporarily adopts to force oneself to analyze a particular perspective of a system or work of knowledge production. Others are considering the value of coexisting ontologies such as using indigenous or archaeologically rediscovered understandings which emphasize non-human species in order to consider conscious or sustainable design.
<br><br>
Practitioners of a field of knowledge production tend to utilize field-specific <strong>canon</strong>ical narratives. Due to an abundance of tacit knowledge necessary to operate in an efficient manner, it seems reasonable to have a list of memorized surface-level maxims, axioms, posits, aphorisms, particularly useful results, and a common lexicon to begin the learning process. Hierarchical models of learning tend to call this learning the rules before one breaks them in a risky act of post-<strong>canon</strong>ical synthesis. This is partially related to the necessity to identify with and be accepted within a field to avoid a state of schizophrenia. The inertia perpetuating choices of broad macroscopic ideas have been called paradigms consisting of a shared system of analogies one uses to understand their own work or epistemes emphasizing the power structures that reinforce them.
<br><br>
Outside of personal interpretations, some macroscopic changes in <strong>canon</strong>ical narratives constitute deterritorialization where a nonlinear narrative has its context removed and is stated as a basic axiom, obscuring its construction, or compressed to a face of a concept. One particular example is the construction of an aesthetic i.e. naming a <strong>canon</strong>ical set of visual cultural elements - especially anachronistic conglomerations. Other examples include appropriation of the word deterritorialization in this paragraph, commodification in general, and attempts to preemptively teach pragmatic models like the scientific method, writing process, or engineering design process without including practice in each context. This further separates the perception and reality of epistemological understanding perhaps to a level of foreign religious enchantment.
<br><br>
Possibilities of larger changes lie in post-modern re-configurations. Current ideas include archaeological reconstruction of <strong>canon</strong>ical narratives and adjustment of practices - both with systematic awareness of the inertia of colonizing structures. Another is separating practices from economic desires for a growth imperative - which may allow time for discussions and practice opportunities which improve value and perception of fields of knowledge production and allow for more freedom to conduct experimental post-<strong>canon</strong>ical development.
<br><br>
Finally, in accelerating society, the repetition of <strong>canon</strong>ical responses rises to the level of noise leading to a question of how to deal with over-stimulation and schizophrenia - and the epistemological choice to outsource one's <strong>canon</strong>ical narratives to others' algorithmic filters.

<h3> 2020-08-17 - Resources for Walking as an Academic Practice</h3>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1d56pgvRwIWjSCkeU1t59aAnh0UyyjJDH&usp=sharing">My Walking Map</a> for reference. </li>
<li> Chucho (Jes&uacute;s) Ocampo Aguilar, a fellow walking artist in MIT's Program in Art, Culture, & Technology, recommended  Francesco Careri's <a href= "https://culicidaearchitecturalpress.com/careri-walkscapes/">Walkscapes</a> as it informs his <a href="https://derivelab.org/"> Practice</a>. It begins by introducing the role of nomadic goers as opposed to sedentary stayers in the history of architecture, followed by an overview of modern walking art, focusing on <a href= "https://www.moma.org/collection/works/184056">Dada Visites</a>, Surrealist deambulations, and  <a href="https://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/theory.html"> Letterist/Situationist D&eacute;rives</a>. It ends with modern architectural Land Art practices.</li>
<li> A substantial number of works on walking have been reviewed <a href= "https://readingandwalking.wpcomstaging.com/">here</a> and on other blogs. </li>
<li> An exploration of every street in NYC by Matt Green is documented <a href= "https://imjustwalkin.com/">here</a> and in the walkumentary, <a href= "https://www.theworldbeforeyourfeet.com/"> The World Before Your Feet</a>. </li>
<li> Also featured in this walkumentary is a fellow walker and former MIT MLK Scholar, Garnette Cadogan, writer of the essay <a href= "https://lithub.com/walking-while-black/"> Walking While Black </a> on the role of race in the walking experience. </li>
<li> In the more anthropological direction, Tim Ingold writes on the cultural significance of <a href= "https://www.google.com/books/edition/Lines/50z7CwAAQBAJ"> Lines </a> while part of the collective <a href= "https://www.deveron-projects.com/the-walking-institute/people/"> The Walking Institute </a> which hosts academics on journeys through Scotland. </li>
<li> In a more athletic vein, a few individuals known as <a href= "https://www.unitedstatescenturionwalkers.com/"> Centurions</a> have continued the tradition of pedestrianism, walking 100mi in one day. (Others have taken on the simpler Kennedy March as proposed by JFK in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_march"> Sports Illustrated </a> to promote physical education - the Centurion Society providing Kennedy March medals if completed in 12 hours).</li>
<li> These walks involve relaxed versions of <a href= "https://www.usatf.org/disciplines/race-walking"> Racewalking</a> rules, no loss of contact and full leg extension, which ultimately limit the race to a track so judges can stare at the racers' legs. Slow-motion cameras were banned it was determined every racewalker was losing contact already and the standard was reduced.</li>
<li> Walks can be tracked to some capacity on <a href= "https://www.google.com/maps/d/"> Google MyMaps</a> but you're limited in layers and exports. There are other programs designed to integrate with biometric sensors or to explore other individuals' walks which are not part of my performative practice.</li>
<li> Of course, if you would walk 500mi and you would walk 500 more and then 500 more and your significant other would too just to break up, look no further than <a href="https://publicdelivery.org/marina-abramovic-the-lovers-the-great-wall-walk/"> Marina Abramović & Ulay </a></li>
