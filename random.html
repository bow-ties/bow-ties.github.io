<h3> 2020-08-17 - Resources for Walking as an Academic Practice</h3>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1d56pgvRwIWjSCkeU1t59aAnh0UyyjJDH&usp=sharing">My Walking Map</a> for reference. </li>
<li> Chucho (Jes&uacute;s) Ocampo Aguilar, a fellow walking artist in MIT's Program in Art, Culture, & Technology, recommended  Francesco Careri's <a href= "https://culicidaearchitecturalpress.com/careri-walkscapes/">Walkscapes</a> as it informs his <a href="https://derivelab.org/"> Practice</a>. It begins by introducing the role of nomadic goers as opposed to sedentary stayers in the history of architecture, followed by an overview of modern walking art, focusing on <a href= "https://www.moma.org/collection/works/184056">Dada Visites</a>, Surrealist deambulations, and  <a href="https://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/theory.html"> Letterist/Situationist D&eacute;rives</a>. It ends with modern architectural Land Art practices.</li>
<li> A substantial number of works on walking have been reviewed <a href= "https://readingandwalking.wpcomstaging.com/">here</a> and on other blogs. </li>
<li> An exploration of every street in NYC by Matt Green is documented <a href= "https://imjustwalkin.com/">here</a> and in the walkumentary, <a href= "https://www.theworldbeforeyourfeet.com/"> The World Before Your Feet</a>. </li>
<li> Also featured in this walkumentary is a fellow walker and former MIT MLK Scholar, Garnette Cadogan, writer of the essay <a href= "https://lithub.com/walking-while-black/"> Walking While Black </a> on the role of race in the walking experience. </li>
<li> In the more anthropological direction, Tim Ingold writes on the cultural significance of <a href= "https://www.google.com/books/edition/Lines/50z7CwAAQBAJ"> Lines </a> while part of the collective <a href= "https://www.deveron-projects.com/the-walking-institute/people/"> The Walking Institute </a> which hosts academics on journeys through Scotland. </li>
<li> In a more athletic vein, a few individuals known as <a href= "https://www.unitedstatescenturionwalkers.com/"> Centurions</a> have continued the tradition of pedestrianism, walking 100mi in one day. (Others have taken on the simpler Kennedy March as proposed by JFK in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_march"> Sports Illustrated </a> to promote physical education - the Centurion Society providing Kennedy March medals if completed in 12 hours).</li>
<li> These walks involve relaxed versions of <a href= "https://www.usatf.org/disciplines/race-walking"> Racewalking</a> rules, no loss of contact and full leg extension, which ultimately limit the race to a track so judges can stare at the racers' legs. Slow-motion cameras were banned it was determined every racewalker was losing contact already and the standard was reduced.</li>
<li> Walks can be tracked to some capacity on <a href= "https://www.google.com/maps/d/"> Google MyMaps</a> but you're limited in layers and exports. There are other programs designed to integrate with biometric sensors or to explore other individuals' walks which are not part of my performative practice.</li>
<li> Of course, if you would walk 500mi and you would walk 500 more and then 500 more and your significant other would too just to break up, look no further than <a href="https://publicdelivery.org/marina-abramovic-the-lovers-the-great-wall-walk/"> Marina Abramović & Ulay </a></li>

<div class="boxitem" id="2020-07-02 - Taxes">
<h3> 2020-07-02 - How to do taxes as an MIT student</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
		<h4>Gather info</h4>
		Most likely, you'll need a W-2 and MITPAY statement (If you owe more than a few thousand to MIT, you'll recieve a 1098-T, otherwise, you'll have to do math yourself)
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4> Tuition and Scholarship Info</h4>
		<p> Tally up qualified tuition expenses within the previous calendar year (tuition, books, fees, materials for art classes)
		Tally up total amount of scholarship money recieved that calendar year (note outside scholarships just offset the value that is directly from MIT - my school district gave me one even after pleading not to)</p>
		<p> Calculate your actual income.
		<br>Note: MIT spring tuition is charged in the December year prior to the application of scholarship money in January but you still technically spend it on qualified tuition expenses.
		<br>Adopting the notation T/S/P for tuition/scholarship/pay:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Calendar year 1 scholarship income = S1		- (T1+T2)
				<br>	This will be negative, so your scholarship income is 0. If (S1+S2)>(T1+T2), this is technically excess_tuition to be payed by scholarship in the next calendar year, but otherwise and for the rest, this is credit_eligible tuition expenses payed with your hard-earned dollars.
				<br> Note: you could also pay taxes this year on (S1-T1) and simply apply T2 expenses to the following year. Just be consistent with your accounting methodology.
			</li>
			<li>
				Calendar year 2 scholarship income = S3+S2	- (T3+T4) - excess_tuition
			</li>
			<li>
				Calendar year 3 scholarship income = S4+S5	- (T5+T6)
			</li>
			<li>
				Calendar year 4 scholarship income = S6+S7	- (T7+T8)
			</li>
			<li>Calendar year 5 scholarship income = S8
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>Federal Income Tax.</h4>
		<p>	Cry because lobbying has prevented you from just sending in your 1040 form to the IRS. Note scholarships and tuition are too complicated for free filing - they generally want you to pay $60 to be able to input it meaning you can save money with H&R Block over TurboTax. The only thing that just barely works is TaxAct. If you are international, good luck.</p>
		<ol>
		<li>
			<p> You are what the world expects - you pay tuition and qualify for a tax credit based on credit_eligible income. I don't know anything about that - read the form 8917 instructions.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p> You make money off of your scholarship.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>
				Figure out if you are a dependent - are you under 24? (your standard deduction is lowered to be slightly above your earned income based on instructions)
			</li>
			<li>
				Angrily navigate each screen until you can submit the above as misc unearned income (along with W-2, 1099, and other income) and the software will write "SCH" in the dots next to your income. If you're an independent contractor, be sure to calculate your medicare contribution and underpayment fee for not submitting quarterly tax payments becaue nobody told you to.
			</li>
			<li>
				Questionably commit dozens of cents of tax fraud because your savings account dividends are always taxed but nobody makes enough to get the form and you need to use the $60 version to submit the extra page
			</li>
			<li>
				Take the standard deduction unless you have tons of business losses to deduct - if you're reading this, you don't.
			</li>
			<li>
				Subtract withheld income from W-2 or other payments
			</li>
			<li>
				That's how much you owe or is owed to you
			</li>
			<li>
				Go for the ACH wire transfer (Your bank's routing number and your account number - for an MITFCU checking share, it's your member number)
			</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>State Taxes</h4>
		<ul>
			<li> Msaeachubaets
				<br>Note: Based on Tax Directive 95-9, only TA/RA/work-dependent scholarships are taxed for non-residents but you must still file a non-resident tax return for other income over a certain amount.
				<ul>
					<li>
						So figure this one out and grab the pdf before submission.
					</li>
					<li>
						Choose to pay the optional higher tax rate because you heart MA.
					</li>
					<li>
						Go for the ACH wire transfer.
					</li>
					<li>
						If not from MA, the department of revenue will require uploads of your social security card, ID, and proof of residency at your home address (anything with name/address) to process your return - you will recieve a case number by mail the next day.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li> Taxes in other states (internationals tune out now).
				<ul>
					<li>
						Sometimes unqualified scholarship income is taxed for residents and sometimes not - MA will tax it and include an underpayment fee for not submitting quarterly tax payments on your unearned income becaue nobody told you to while PA doesn't consider it income.
					</li>
					<li>
						Either way, you will need to submit your other income and amount of state tax paid to MA along with uploading/mailing a copy of your MA tax return.
					</li>
					<li>	
						Follow your state's math based on the amount paid to another state, the relative tax rates, and memoranda of understanding between adjacent states.
					</li>
					<li>	
						Also include your use tax because you definitely know how much state taxe you owe for online purchases.
					</li>
					<li>	
						Again, go for the ACH wire transfer.
					</li>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>Local taxes. </h4>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Your local school district will have been persuaded to process their local taxes through a collections agency branded as a "tax innovations" company and we'll be navigating their circa 1996 online user interface.
			</li>
			<li>	
				Designed for people who never left their home county, you will be greeted with many interesting required fields such as the school district code you paid your $0 in local taxes to - which is then checked against the list of real school district codes...resulting in a stupider looking rendering of a W-2.
			</li>
			<li>	
				Alternatively, you may be able to check $0 because student.
			</li>
			<li>	
				Again, go for the ACH wire transfer or credit/debit as all cost the same.
			</li>
			<li>	
				You'll probably also owe an occupational tax for the luxury of having an address in the county and being an adult - this is about $10 with a $2 processing fee.	
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>
