	<p>Before I arrived, our lecture demo website server crashed and was hastily rebuilt as a node server which re-hosts documents from a google drive. I proceeded to rewrite it using a python script which downloads modified documents and generates a list using a metadata database.</p>
	<p>Upon changing out name from TSG to PIRL, I requested pirl.mit.edu and updated to using SSL certificates.</p>
