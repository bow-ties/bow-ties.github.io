	<p>Ceramic</p><p>My mom always wanted me to make her a fountain and I'm the only one doing "well", so I decided to build a well. This, the roof, holds a normalized inverse Fourier transform of a Fourier transform in the QM convention. The base has the time independent Schr√∂dinger / Energy Eigenvalue Equation embedded on it.</p>
