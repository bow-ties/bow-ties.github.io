Because of snow and an unexpected artist in residence, I had 3 days to complete this project in class. After repeating a cut paper design and transferring it into the bounds of a freehanded seahorse, I began applying the wax. When the fountain pen tipped, I managed to spill out a "sea spirit" on the right. It's good to know I'm haunted. Anyway, I became carried away with realism, as usual, adding a background with schools of fish and the sun.
