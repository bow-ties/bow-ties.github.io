	<h3>Quantization Physics (2019-2020)</h3>
<p>	In January 2019, I worked on <a href ="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4757-2063-1" >Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics</a> in the Physics Directed Reading Program to explore symplectic geometry and the algebraic structure of observables and symmetries as seen in this <a href ="https://phys-drp.mit.edu/sites/default/files/bowties.pdf" > presentation </a>.
	<br>
In January 2020, I continued with learning about the methods of <a href ="https://math.berkeley.edu/~alanw/GofQ.pdf" >Geometric Quantization</a>, an attempt to choose a self-consistent symmetry-preserving map between classical and quantum systems which is useful for Chern-Simons theory and qubits as seen in this <a href ="https://phys-drp.mit.edu/sites/default/files/bowties_0.pdf" > presentation</a>.
<br>
For my <a href="img/806paper.pdf"> 8.06 term paper </a>, I decided to explore the competing form of quantization known as deformation quantization or the phase space formulation. It was arrived at by two methods: simplifying Fourier transforms to do statistical mechanics and as a quantization to symmetrically treat position and momentum operators. By exponentiation operator representations of position and momentum and canonical commutation relations, it is possible to represent a dynamics using a distribution in the classical phase space rather than a representation of a Hilbert space given a representation of the quantized operators. The only requirement to do so is to deform the one-to-one correspondence of classical and quantum symmetries. The Wigner-Weyl transform is one method of doing so though others are used such as that by Roy Glauber to describe coherent states.
