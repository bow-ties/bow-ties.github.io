	<h3>Very Early Art (2002-2004)</h3>
	<p> I've collected all of these <a href="img/large/preart.pdf">here</a>. These were made in preschool through kindergarten. They include me latching on to aspects like vehicles with wheels, engines, doors, keys, balance, a face/sun motif in the corner, struts/supports, and drawing the boundary of the paper.</p> </figcaption>
