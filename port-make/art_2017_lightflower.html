	<h3>Light Flower (2017)</h3>
	<p> For my freshman advising seminar, a team of Talia Blum, Erica Chiu, Anna Kooperberg, and I sought to construct an interactive kinetic art project. Ultimately, we ended up with a flower that opens and changes colors as you approach it using an IR sensor, rack gear, mechanical plastic connections, and, of course, an Arduino with hand-made interface board.
	Talia and I were the associate advisors the following year.</p>
