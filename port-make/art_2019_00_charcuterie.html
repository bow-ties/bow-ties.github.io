	<h3>Charcuterie (ongoing hobby)</h3>
	<p>I have made on the order of 20 cheese boards for art club parties, fused glass workshops, and general meetings with advisees over the years. I'm not necessarily a cheesemonger and am generally limited to the stock at Star Market - though I have gone to the MA Cheese Festival. For a guide based on my experience, see the <a href ="img/cheesecraft.pdf"> guide</a> I wrote for an anthropology course about craft.</p>
