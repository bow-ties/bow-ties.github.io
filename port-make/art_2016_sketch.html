	<h3>Close Up Sketch (2016)</h3>
	<p>For this weekly sketch book, I chose to focus on the fine details of my antique pencil sharpener collection. This piece features one of the widest ranges of value I have achieved.</p>

	<h3>Faith Sketch (2016)</h3>
	<p>For this sketchbook, I interpreted faith as that in ensuring my Lego space shuttle does not break while I draw it. For some reason, I though trying to accent regular patterns would be easier than abnormal ones, but instead mistakes are easier to see. Here, I mainly focused on proper relative perspective geometry. I'm not necessarily pursuing space exploration, but I've had this collecting dust in my room for years.</p>
