<h3>Brandeised (2019)</h3>
	<p> Building off the themes Interspecies Communication and the Anthropocene, Brandeised is dialogue between historic case law and modern laundry tracking technology. Additionaly, the project was traced as a scientific investigation with the laboratory notebook shown alongside the piece. My pamphlet description is copied below. </p>

	<p>In 1908, Louis D. Brandeis, an overachieving Harvard Law graduate, delivered the first dossier of scientific evidence to the Supreme Court of the United States. In this case, Muller v. Oregon, a woman&#8217;s employer had been fined for making her work more than 10 hours – all due to a load of laundry. Brandeis argued to uphold the state&#8217;s fine based on scientific consensus about a woman&#8217;s physical abilities and role in society. The resulting decision marks an early attempt to regulate labor and move past the desire for ever increasing work in the industrialized world – all with morally questionable flaws.</p>
	<br>
	<p>To fulfill the modern desire for efficiency, we have faced a number of ironies – none more apparent than the desire to launder our surroundings by pushing waste somewhere else.</p>
	<br>
	<p>More alarmingly, we continue to facialize our world in a particular way. We see scientists and engineers on a journey towards infinite efficiency as we are presented with well-curated displays of progress rather than the haphazard laboratories behind. Worse, the most hidden of laboratories are in the early stages of tracking new critical zones – investigating runaway effects so that others may design a solution.</p>
	<br>
	<p>So when does the face of a critical system become an extension of our species and our problem? The answer may continue from our scientific fantasy – when it achieves for us like a monkey in orbit or is surviving a crisis where corporations may appear to intervene like ducks in an oil spill. At most other times, the artist holds the role of spreading concern.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Like Brandeis, our critical zone begins with a load of laundry. In particular, we observe the phenomenon of microfiber pollution – one of many unchecked sources of ubiquitous marine plastic. In our cybernetically-controlled monitoring lab, we see the efficiency-driven publically-accessible usage of washing machines at Brandeis&#8217;s namesake university. After tracing the battered fiber remnants through the sewer system, we emulate their spread and staining of the environment by metaphoric bubbles.</p>
	<br>
	<p>This is Brandeis&#8217;s Laundry.</p>
