	<h3>Bowtie Holder (2015)</h3>
	<p>Wood, Nails, Acrylic</p>
	<p>Upon acquiring my 9th bowtie, I realized their loose ends called for a compact storage location, so I set out to manufacture a custom solution to hang with my clothes and allow me to store even more, so I did. I now have 36 but can only fit 12 so now it holds greeting cards.</p>
