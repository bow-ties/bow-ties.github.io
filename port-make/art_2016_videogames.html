<h3>Technology Student Association Video Game Design Entries (2011-2016)</h3>


	<h4>Portals of Math (2011-2012) </h4>
<p>
	(Made with Jon Brown, Isaiah Magliocca)<br>
	<br>
	Made in GameMaker 8.1 Lite<br>
	<br>
	You are a stick who must solve math problems by jumping through portals (which, inspired my Minecraft, glow purple)<br>
	- includes animations, transitions, a very bad movement system (up/down/left/right apply an instantaneous impulse but not if another button is pressed, gravity is very strong)
	- includes original soundtrack
</p>

<h4>Portals of Math II (2012-2013) </h4>
<p>
	(Made with Jon Brown, Logan Rickley)<br>
	<br>
	Made in GameMaker 8.1 (Exists on a DVD that I no longer have a drive to read; and as a .gm81 file for which I can open and take some development screenshots but do not have a Standard license to re-compile; GameMaker:Studio 1.0 no longer allows logging in; and GameMaker:Studio 2 cannot open .gm81 files.)<br>
	<br>
	You are a stick who must solve math problems by jumping through portals (which now glow green)<br>
	- implemented scrolling platformer with out-of-bounds area, tilesets, began using scripts under step/draw events rather than built-in drag/drop functions<br>
	- includes another original soundtrack
</p>

<h4>Squish The Conqueror (2013-2014) </h4>
<p>
	(10th place PA-TSA Video Game Design; Made with Jon Brown, Matthew Mantini - storyline, Rory Beebout, Chase Toth)<br>
	<br>
	Written in C++ using SFML 2.1 for graphics<br>
	<br>
	A blob named Squish is tasked by his grandfather to take over the world. He must solve math problems to eat the correct blobs/ants/mice to grow.<br>
	- includes another original soundtrack<br>
	- Better graphics, cloud animation, hints<br>
	- implemented state machine architecture and dynamic memory management

<h4> Space Investors (2014-2015) </h4>
<p>
	(Made with Jon Brown, Braidon Lape)<br>
	<br>
	Made in GameMaker:Studio 1.4 mostly implemented in scripts<br>
	<br>
	Earn money for your space program by taking on contracts <br>
		1. Escape Atmospheric Resistance using Probe-Originated Kinetic Energy TESTing (EARPOKETEST) = play breakout but you're demonstrating the Air Pressure Pump Leveling Experiment (APPLE) on clouds and make money for each impact and lose money for each device you lose	<br>
		2. Resisting Enduring and Loosely Redirecting Asteroids Technical Showcase (REALRATS) = dodge asteroids but you can launch probes upwards for a cost that can be recovered for each asteroid it collects<br>
		3. Retake Our Base On Comet Orbitz-Pzykatil IV (ROBOCOPIV) = dodge randomized asteroids and laser-shooting rovers while navigating a platformer to reach a door, paying for repairs	<br>
		4. Open Up and ReMove Our Security System (OURMOSS) = dodge randomized asteroids and player-targeting laser-shooting rovers to reach security system panels, paying for repairs<br>
	Choice of rocket parts in beginning does impact movement speeds and thus gameplay strategy<br>
	<br>
	- implemented randomized npc employees, mission screens, particles, dynamic loading screens, AI targeting<br>
	- includes another original soundtrack

<h4>Orion Tale (2015-2016) </h4>
<p>
	(9th place PA-TSA Video Game Design; Made with Jon Brown, Rory Beebout)<br>
	<br>
	Made in GameMaker:Studio 1.4 mostly implemented in scripts<br>
	<br>
	You are 4 astronauts on a space mission who must:<br>
	1. collect supplies dodging security guards who attack when alerted<br>
	2. dodge aliens while descending platformer level using fuel to collect supplies<br>
	3. collect supplies avoiding guards while playing breakout on other half of screen to spawn guards/supplies/explosions and reveal security system<br>
	4. dodge aliens while descending platformer level using fuel to disable systems<br>
	and also dodge asteroid fields between levels, using resources to increase speed and noting that food resources are used up over time<br>
	<br>
	- implemented UI overlay with health indicators, inventory, buttons, map; levels start paused to read mission; randomly named characters; more random asteroids (location, velocity, color)<br>
	- includes another original soundtrack
