	<h3>Miscellaneous TSA Projects (2011-2017)</h3>
	<h4> Robot (2017) </h4>
	<p> Entry for PA-TSA Robotics with Jon Brown, Devin Fisher, Chase Toth. This is the only time I actually built a robot and as such it doesn't have a good name. It was finished at the last minute and no testing was done in the final field so it got stuck in the corner unable to pick up balls but it was still in the top 10 due to documentation.</p>

	<h4> Fresnel Distillation (2017) </h4>
	<p> A not-very-feasible idea for an entry for TSA Engineering Design - but I don't come up with ideas only implement and document them - so we decided to build a water purification system that involves directing sunlight to boil water then collecting the condensed vapor.</p>

	<h4> In Need of The Wright Training (2015) </h4>
	<p> This entry for TSA Children's Stories was about a bird learning to fly. You can go read it <a href="childrens_story.pdf">here</a>.</p>
	
	<h4> Magnets (2017) </h4>
	<p> Entry for SciVis with Jon Brown, Devin Fisher, Bobby Murtha in which I explain the quantum properties of magnets.<br>
	A victim of Digital Obsolescence (it only exists on a DVD I cannot read)
	</p>
	
	<h4> Nuclear Energy (2014) </h4>
	<p> Entry for Energy Sources with Jon Brown, Chase Toth in which I explain nuclear energy statistics.<br>
	A victim of Digital Obsolescence (it only exists on a DVD I cannot read)
	</p>
	
	<h4> It would be hard to document Essays on Technology, Future Technology Teacher, Tech Bowl, or Coding </h4>
