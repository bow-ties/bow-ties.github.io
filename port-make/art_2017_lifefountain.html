	<p>Mixed Media (Ceramic, Glass, Wire, Fountain)</p>
	<p>My final HS art project. Rather self-explanatory. The water was hard to control so now it's an outdoor fountain</p>

	<p>Since you scrolled down, I'll give you some more details. My art teacher had purchased materials for fusing glass which sat for months with nobody attempting to use it. After testing with some simple details, I realized organic shapes carried over best and decided on a wet outdoor aesthetic. I realized that glass would allow a fountain to look more unteresting than my solid ceramic one in the past. I was also in a wire-sculpting phase so that forms the main structure.</p>
