<h3>Bean Counting Pi Day Pie (2022)</h3>
	<p> For pi day, I decided to bake a bean pie. I began by sorting and counting the contents of a bag of beans.
	<br><br>
	So, in summary, Hurst's HamBeens Cajun 15 BEAN SOUP contains 4646 plus or minus 64 beans. The ingredients list says contains 15 of 17 listed varieties.
	This batch contains 16 varieties - the two kidney varieties are combined on the ingredients list as "kidney". The two missing are yelloweye and "small white beans" which appears to be a term for the other white beans thrown in without being pre-sorted.
	<br><br>
	Errors are due to extrapolation by weighing [yellow pea and lentil have a systematic error from whiteish fragments and yellow fragments - and white kidney vs northern are hard to classify but that error doesn't change the total (it has covariance). Counts without uncertainty are exact, 0.5s are half-beans. Also split peas and lentils are called beans which the UN does not agree with - also split peas are half-peas so realistically one should halve the number.

	I then picked out beans following the pattern: <br>
	3	navy<br>
	1	pinto<br>
	4	navy<br>
	1	cranberry<br>
	5	navy<br>
	9	pink<br>
	2	navy<br>
	6	small red<br>
	5	navy<br>
	3	dark kidney<br>
	5	navy<br>
	8	light kidney<br>
	9	navy<br>
	7	baby lima<br>
	9	navy<br>
	3	black<br>
	2	navy<br>
	3	white kidney<br>
	8	navy<br>
	4	northern<br>
	6	navy<br>
	2	pinto<br>
	... <br>
	until I arrived at 299 beans.

	Finally, I incorporated my tediously-counted beans into a <a href="https://tastecooking.com/recipes/bean-pie/"> bean pie recipe </a>.
