<h3>Physics Instructional Resources Lab Demonstration Apparatuses (2022-)</h3>
	<p>One of my roles as a technical instructor is designing new physics demonstration apparatuses.</p>
	<p>Here's a reconstructed showcase of Torricelli's Law using fluorescent dyed water prepared for a demo show.</p>

	<p>Here's a cart which triggers a weight to fall on it, slowing its motion (work must be done to speed up the falling block as opposed to the situation of a cart dropping sand which does not slow down).</p>

	<p>This is a design of a classic railgun where a bar conducts current between two rails thus experiencing a lorentz force in a magnetic field. Notably, it uses 30-60amps of current.</p>
