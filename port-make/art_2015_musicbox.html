	<h3>Music Box (2015)</h3>
	<p>Entry for PA-TSA Electronic Research & Experimentation<br>
	This music box combined synthesizers and pre-programmed hits such as:<br>
<em>Take Me Out To The Ballgame<br>
Oh My Darling, Clementine<br>
Korobeiniki/Tetris Theme<br>
Battle Hymn of the Republic<br>
Yankee Doodle<br>
and the Ievan Polka</em><br>
- I hand-transcribed sheet music to durations and "numbered keys on a piano" [correcting for key signatures] which are actively converted to PWM frequencies <br>
- a bar graph would light up corresponding to the pitch being played <br>
- one could switch off/on the synthesizers and pre-programmed songs <br>
- the audio output uses a separate power supply <br>
- some bits are soldered to a perfboard <br>
- do not look too closely at this schematic <br>
