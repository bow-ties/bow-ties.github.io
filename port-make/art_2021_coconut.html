	<h3>Coconut Project (2020-)</h3>
	<p> For my photography class, I began taking photos exploring the city with a hobby horse I named Coconut after Monty Python and the Holy Grail. This continued my anthropological exploration of companion species and fit into the larger Boston Metropolitan Trail project with fellow academics. Read all about my project in <a href="img/coconut2.pdf">this expanding booklet</a>. </p>
