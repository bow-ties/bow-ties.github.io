	<h3>Cereal Research (2019)</h3>
	<p> At one point I noticed an abundance of cereals being released which have no reason to exist - simply look at recent years in the <a href="https://www.mrbreakfast.com/cereal_timeline.asp"> Cereal Timeline </a>.
	<img src="img/large/cereal.jpg"/> <br>
	To keep track of these, I began a collection along with a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WV4VnuyxTWIXFKLsbqaLV7N6iYWdozo-UwfA0IlrCM8/edit?usp=sharing"> Spreadsheet </a> of my unscientific ratings. This expanded into an attempt to find correlations between base grain, percent sugar, price, and rating. <br>
	Ultimately, only qualitative conclusions can be made: I dislike corn and sugar has minimal impact unless over 40 percent - at which point the product is usually designed to mimic a sugary snack.
