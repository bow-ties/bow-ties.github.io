<h3>Edgerton Center Activities (2020-2021)</h3>

	<h4> Pinball Course </h4>
	<p> In January 2021, I was the TA for a pinball machine building class. I ultimately laser cut, 3D printed, and packaged parts for 25 kits. After tutorials on design for 3D printing, laser cutting, and vinyl cutting, we made+mailed out around 200 parts for students.</p>
	<p> You can have a look at the <a href="img/pinball_guide.pdf">assembly guide</a> and <a href="img/pinball_final.pdf">final presentations</a>.

	<h4> CP* B*X Kit </h4>
	<p> I also worked on assembling 5000 14-piece <a href="https://edgerton.mit.edu/node/3020">engineering kits</a> for MIT Admissions - finding efficient ways to open and tape the tops of 5000 9V batteries, extract 5000 wire strippers from clamshell packaging, and to lay out an assembly line - and personally making around half - plus pictures for the instructions.</p>

	<h4> Muon Detector </h4>
	<p> In summer 2020, I virtually mentored a team of high schoolers in Barcelona to build a muon detector based off the Cosmic Watch project. Their initial idea was a Geiger counter, but, due to safety concerns, I reduced the maximum voltage being handled from 600V to ~25V</p>
	<p> Here is a Zoom screenhot of our first hint of evidence that the circuit was amplifying and extending pulses - and that they occurred at about the proper rate for the volume of scintillator.</p>

	<p> Here is the basic schematic poorly cropped:</p>

	<h4> Mentor Shirts </h4>
	<p> Before the pandemic, I learned to use a Cricut Maker by cutting our logo in different colors of iron-on vinyl before aligning and applying to shirts for all of our mentors. I also used a Brother CNC embroidery machine to put our names on them - along with testing Ink/Stitch for more complex shapes.</p>
