	<p>Over IAP, I participated in the Suffolk County House of Corrections Prison Mural Painting Project in which 10 MIT students and 10 female prisoners enrolled in pastel/oil classes with either less than one year sentences remaining or in ICE custody came together to turn a multipurpose space into a studio resulting in this collaborative (and later <a href="https://artivive.com/">augmented-reality</a> upgraded) mural.</p>
