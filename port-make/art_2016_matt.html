	<p>On the first day of calculus, the teacher showed a magic square algorithm and a few examples students had made up to 57 x 57 all by students named Matt. Since Matt wasn't trying, I decided to work on a 63x63 one in Art Club. I decided to color in numbers of interest found via a C++ program I wrote: primes, twin primes, perfect squares, and powers of numbers who have more than one appearing.</p>
