<h3>Junior Lab Summer Activities (2023)</h3>
	<p>This summer, I worked to increase our inventory from 54 to 74 Cosmic Watch muon detectors. This involved trying to find an simple method of soldering delicate temperature and moisture-sensitive surface-mount Silicon PhotoMultiplier chips (ON Semiconductor SiPM) - ultimately, I used Chipquik Lead-Free Removal Alloy and SMD291 No-Clean Flux which worked at low enough temperatures to avoid boiling off the moisture accumulated in the chips while sitting out over the past year. I discovered that the latest batch of boards were failing to boot because the assembler substituted LT1807 opamps with LT1819s. In theory, they have better performance but require more than 3.6V across the rails so were outputting a constant 300mV preventing a baseline measurement. </p>

	<p>I also worked on Roger, our copy of the old Haystack Small Radio Telescope. The signal chain is [antenna cut out of semirigid coax] -> [21cm filter] -> [semirigid coax] -> [preamplifier] -> [digital receiver] -> [RG-6 cable] -> [ground controller]. We have replaced  [antenna cut out of semirigid coax], [semirigid coax], and the F-connectors between the receiver and RG-6 cable. We have swapped a bunch of [preamplifier]s and still get bad data. We swapped the [ground controller] and still got junk but the other [ground controller] does not process replies from the stepper motor. The bad data appears to be a digital processing artifact in the histogram which is independent of set frequency - and the uncalibrated power measurements looking at a wall or TEST reads 300+ counts no matter where we point. We could look at the noise diode in the future - it was likely temporarily broken until I replaced the grounding wire nut. We also added a split loom wire </p>

	<p>Additionally, I worked to re-organize "the lair" into hardware, electrical, and electronics areas.</p>
