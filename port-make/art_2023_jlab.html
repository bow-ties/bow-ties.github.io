<h3>Junior Lab Summer Activities (2023)</h3>
	<p>This summer, I worked to increase our inventory from 54 to 74 Cosmic Watch muon detectors. This involved soldering delicate temperature and moisture-sensitive surface-mount Silicon PhotoMultiplier chips and replacing two opamps on each partially populated board.</p>

	<p>I also worked on Roger, our copy of the old Haystack Small Radio Telescope. The signal chain is [antenna cut out of semirigid coax] -> [21cm filter] -> [semirigid coax] -> [preamplifier] -> [digital receiver] -> [RG-6 cable] -> [ground controller]. We have replaced  [antenna cut out of semirigid coax], [semirigid coax], and the F-connectors between the receiver and RG-6 cable. We have swapped a bunch of [preamplifier]s and still get bad data. We swapped the [ground controller] and still got junk but the other [ground controller] does not process replies from the stepper motor. The bad data appears to be a digital processing artifact in the histogram which is independent of set frequency - and the uncalibrated power measurements looking at a wall or TEST reads 300+ counts no matter where we point. We could look at the noise diode in the future - it was likely temporarily broken until I replaced the grounding wire nut. We also added a split loom wire </p>

	<p>Additionally, I worked to re-organize "the lair" into hardware, electrical, and electronics areas.</p>
