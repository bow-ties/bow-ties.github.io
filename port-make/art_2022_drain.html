<h3>French Drain Engineering (2022)</h3>
	<p>To divert water away from my downspout and prevent ponding in my yard and runoff into a driveway, I researched, measured, designed, procured, dug, placed, and tested a french drain system. The project ultimately required 24 hours of manual labor.</p>
	
	<p>A downspout could be extended with a simple shallow PVC pipe but to prevent ponding elsewhere, I went for an entire french drain installation with perforated pipe to allow excess groundwater to drain, a gravel trench to retain water in voids, a non-woven landscaping fabric to prevent grass roots and soil runoff from clogging. I also added a catch basin to collect water from a porch and landscaping bed. Conveniently, the end of my yard drops off abruptly to just the right height to have a 1% slope on the pipe from the catch basin.</p>

	<p>I began digging with a drain spade/sharpshooter shovel using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgRoxIzqLRI">this method</a> but ultimately decided to use a tiller instead. Due to my rocky soil, I needed to use a hammer 8 times to remove rocks stuck on the tines.</p>
