<h3>RF Receiver (2021)</h3>
	<p>This is direct conversion receiver tuned for a performance art project where volunteers hold a 500ft wire in the hollow interior of a helical ramp to the MBTA Alewife Station parking garage - forming an antenna with highest gain around 5-9MHz (up to highly uncertain measurement of building).</p>
	<p>The device has a rugged enclosure with BNC+SMA connections and a terminal block for accepting rugged 8AWG wiring (chosen so performers don't break it, also on sale at Home Depot).</p>
	<p>After looking at designs from MIT Lincoln Labs Cantenna and the MIT Haystack SRT, I decided to use the SA602A Mixer IC with local oscillator and input/output filtering designs from the datasheet. There is a superheterodyne output in one ear and a power level (from a peak detector) synthesized (with a voltage-controlled oscillator) into an audible output in the other. </p>
