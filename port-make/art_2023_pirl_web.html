<h3>Physics Education Group Website (2024-)</h3>
	<p>I have been one of the major designers and content writers for our larger group's website, <a href="https://peg.mit.edu">peg.mit.edu</a>. This year, MIT migrated from Drupal to more feature-rich CampusPress which has an functioning method for creating protected pages. Collecting quotes from previous discussions, I wrote an outline for the website which I presented at a group meeting for feedback. At following team-website meetings, we encountered the difficulty of designing for many audiences. We want to make clear that we are the "non-faculty academic instructional staff" who are housed in internal groups but have larger projects sometimes including faculty - but also we desire to curate the continuous history of physics education projects in the department which do not have a direct descendant group such as work by faculty commitees or defunct centers.</p>

<h3>Physics Instructional Resources Lab Website (2022-)</h3>
	<p>Before I arrived, our lecture demo website server crashed and was hastily rebuilt as a node server which re-hosts documents from a google drive. I proceeded to rewrite it using a python script which downloads modified documents and generates a list using a metadata database.</p>
	<p>Upon changing out name from TSG to PIRL, I requested <a href="https://pirl.mit.edu">pirl.mit.edu</a> and updated to using SSL certificates.</p>
