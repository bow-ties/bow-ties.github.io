<p>Each of these implement easy/deterministic calculations and were mainly an exercise in development for Windows from scratch i.e. without a GUI editor thus forcing one to learn how the operating system was designed - and then trying to interface using more modern C++ paradigms.</p>

<h4>Physics Simulator Collection (2015)</h4>
<p>
This program implements a number of routine physics calculations.<br> It was the second place entry at the state level. <br>

<h4>LinExtractor (2016)</h4>
<p>
This program re-implements linear algebra functions on complex matrices. <br> It was the second place entry at the state level. <br>
