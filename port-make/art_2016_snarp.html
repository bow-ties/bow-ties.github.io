	<h3>SNARP's Not Another Rectangle Plotter (2016)</h3>
	<p>This recursive acronym which I built so my friend, Matt Popovnak, could cross "build a CNC machine" off his bucket list. The idea of linear of motion was easy to attain and so was mechanical construction. Reverse engineering the drifted PWM motor logic and driving took the most time. The system plots from a set of points to a resolution of 256x256 based not on stepper motors on encoders but on time. It begins with a calibration step measuring time from the origin to limit switches and back. Drift based on battery level causes significant error over time, resulting in offset drawings.</p>
