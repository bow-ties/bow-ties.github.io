	<h3>Rocket Team Activities (2017-2018)</h3>
	<h4> Kalman Filter </h4>
	<p> On the avionics team, I worked on developing firmware in C++ using an extended Kalman filter to combine sensor values and an expected flight profile for "sensor fusion".
	<ul>
	<li>The rocket is spinning and not angled straight up, so we must use a separate Madgwick Filter to find, integrate z acceleration.</li>
	<li>Drag is a nonlinear force, so we must compute Jacobians from past measurements.</li>
	<li>Over Mach 1, the particular rocket design involves Prandtl-Meyer expansion fans which require a factor of 10 error on barometer reading.</li>
	<li>All data is simulated based on assumptions about mounting+weather as data logging has failed due to flash/battery issues in separate development cycle.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4> Dispersion Analysis </h4>
	<p>For an FAA Class 3 waiver, one must provide a map around the launch site confidence intervals where a rocket is expected to land with functioning/non-functioning parachutes, different wind conditions, and other factors such as launch angle. Typically, the workflow was to take motor data from BurnSim and aerodynamic profiles from RASAero and place them into a proprietary $1000 program to generate these graphs. Previously, an entire VM was used to run a Flask server to modify files and run them in OpenRocket. To replace this, I created a context menu to set mean & standard deviation for parameters, then run arbitrarily many (memory-limited) simulations with results appended to a csv file. </p>
	<h4> L1 Rocket </h4> <img src="img/large/rockets.jpg"/>
	<p>As with all Rocket Team members, I developed my clone of <a href="http://reilley.net/">Andrew Reilley</a>'s L1 Rocket (LOC-precision stock parts and laser-cut centering rings/fins simulated in OpenRocket). The following month, I produced another in under 2 hours. And the following year, I co-led the team build session.</p>
	
	<h4> Onion Andrew Rocket </h4>
	<p> When Andrew graduated, we replaced him with a character named Onion Andrew based on Homestar Runner character <a href="http://www.hrwiki.org/wiki/Onion_Bubs">Onion Bubs</a>. Eventually, in 2022, an iteration of Onion Andrew came into my possession and began rotting so I turned him into a rocket </p>
